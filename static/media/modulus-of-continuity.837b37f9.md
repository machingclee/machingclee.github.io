##### Results

As I leave academia for a very long time, this blog is to record those standard results I need to digest theory in optimal transport which helps me understand the Wasserstein loss in GAN theory.

>
> - Every continuous function $f:(X,\|\cdot \|)\to (Y,d_Y)$ restricted to a set compact in $X$ admits a **_continuous_**, **_increasing_** and **_subadditive_** modulus of continuity.\
>   **_Proof._** Simply observe that $\omega:[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$ is increasing and is subadditive.

> **Proposition.** Let $M$ be a metric space, and $S\subset M$, the following are equivalent:
>
> - $S$ is **_compact_**
> - $S$ is **_sequentially compact_**
> - $S$ is **_complete and totally bounded_**

> **Fact (Arzela-Ascoli's Theorem).** Let $M$ be a compact metric space and $S\subseteq C(M)$, then the following are equivalent
>
> - $S$ is compact (or **_sequentially compact_** by the fact above) in $C(M)$
> - $S$ is **_closed, uniformlly bounded and uniformlly equicontinuous_**
> - $S$ is **_closed, pointwise bounded and equicontinuous_**

> **Proposition.** If $f_\alpha$'s share the same modulus of continuity for all $\alpha$, then so is $\sup_\alpha f$ and $\inf_\alpha f$.

**Remark.** Modulus of continuity is also known as a **_bound of a continuity_**. It provides us a method to determine equi-continuity of a set of functions (in case they come from a special kind of construction).

> **Proposition.** If $M$ is a compact metric space, then every $f\in C(M)$ is uniformly continuous.

> **Proposition.** Let $X,Y$ be compact metric spaces and $c:X\times Y\to \R$ be continuous, there is a increasing continuous function $\omega:[0,\infty)\to [0,\infty)$ such that

> is called **_Kantorovich potentials_** for the transport from $\mu$ to $\nu$.

> **Proposition.** If $c$ is $C^1$, $\varphi$ is a Kantorovich potential for the cost $c$ in the transport from $\mu$ to $\nu$ and $(x_0,y_0)$ belongs to the support of an optimal transport plan $\gamma$, then
>
> - $\nabla \varphi(x_0) = \nabla_x c(x_0,y_0)$, provided $\varphi$ is differentiable at $x_0$.
> - In particular, the gradients of two different Kantorovich potentials conincide on every point $x_0\in \spt (u)$ where both the potentials are differentiable.

**Remark.** Recall that $(x, y)\in \spt(\gamma)$ if and only if $\gamma(B_{X\times Y}((x,y),r))>0$ for any $r>0$.

> **Definition.** For $\Omega\subseteq \R^d$ we say that $c:\Omega\times \Omega\to \R$ satisfies the **_Twist condition_** whenever $c$ is differentiable w.r.t. $x$ at every point, and the map $y\mapsto \nabla_x c(x_0,y)$ is injective for every $x_0$.

**Remark.** This condition is also known in economic as _Spence-Mirrlees condition_. For "nice" domains and cost functions, it corresponds to $\dis \det\sbrac{\frac{\pd^2 c}{\pd y_i \pd x_j}}\neq 0$.

> **Proposition.** Given probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ on a compact domain $\Omega \subseteq \R^d$, there exists an optimal transport plan $\gamma$ for the cost $c(x,y) = h(x-y)$ with $h:\R^d\to \R$ strictly convex. It is unique and of the form $(\id, T)_{\#}\mu$ for some $T$, provided $\mu$ is absolutely continuous and $|\pd \Omega|=0$. Moreover, there exists a Kantorovich potential $\varphi$ such that
>
> $$
> T(x) = x- (\nabla h)^{-1}(\nabla \varphi(x)).
> $$

> **Proposition.** Given a function $\chi:\R^d\to \R\cup \{-\infty\}$, we define $u_\chi :\R^d \to \R\cup\{+\infty\}$ by $u_\chi(x)=\frac{1}{2}|x|^2 -\chi(x)$. Then we have $u_{\chi^c} = (u_\chi)^*$. In particular, a function $\zeta$ is $c$-concave if and only if $x\mapsto \frac{1}{2} |x|^2-\zeta(x)$ is convex and l.s.c..

<proof>

**_Proof._** The first part follows directly from computation. For the second part, since a function is convex and l.s.c. if and only if it is a supremum of affine transforms, but then such a supremum can again be expressed as a convex conjugate of a function $g$, therefore,

$$
\begin{align*}
u_\zeta \text{ is convex and l.s.c.}
&\iff \frac{1}{2} \|x\|^2 - \zeta (x) \xlongequal{\exists g} g^* = \sup_{x'}\inner{x,x'}-g(x') \\
&\iff \zeta(x) =  \inf_{x'}\bigg(\underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\|x-x'\|^2}_{c(x,x')} - \underbrace{(\|x'\|^2 - g(x'))}_{\psi(x')}\bigg)\\
&\iff \zeta (x) = \psi^c(x),
\end{align*}
$$

where $\psi = \|\id\|^2 -g$, therefore the second part follows.

</proof>

**Remark.** Two gaps in the proof:

- Why a convex lsc function can be expressed as a supremum of affine transforms?
- Why a supremum of affine transforms can be expressed as a convex conjugate of some function defined on the same domain?
  We will com back and fill in these gaps. The second part requires a use of Hahn-Banach Theorem.

> **Recall.** Real-valued convex functions on $\R^d$ are automatically continuous and locally Lipzchizs in the interior of their domain (on which $f<\infty$).

> **Theorem.** A function $f:\R^d\to \R\cup \{+\infty\}$ is convex and l.s.c. $\iff$ there is a family of affine functions $\{f_\alpha\}$ such that $f(x):=\sup_\alpha f_\alpha(x)$. This family can also be chosen to be the family of all affine functions smaller than $f$.

**Remark.** One implication is trivial, for the opposide side, a precise proof requires the use of Hahn-Banach Theorem in its geometrical form. We will digest the proof from https://www.math.uh.edu/~rohop/fall_06/Chapter5.pdf.
