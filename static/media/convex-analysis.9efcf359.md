intro: Start the journey of convex analysis in an attempt to fully understand the technical tools needed in optimal transport. In this article we digest the material from <a href="https://www.math.uh.edu/~rohop/fall_06/Chapter5.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1PSKAw9-0H5ziYna8UXqIuXgyAvuAIUsMu8TXb-EqbIILBuXpHUZwUoVA">Chapter 5 Convex Optimization in Function Space</a>, I also fill in the important missing detail in the proof (the author is a bit rushing).




##### Geometric Version of Hahn-Banach Theorem and its Consequence

<!-- > **Theorem.** In a reflexive Banach space $X$ a bounded sequence $\{x_n\}$ contains a weakly convergent subsequence. -->

> **Definition.** Let $\mu\in V^*\setminus\{0\}$ and $\alpha\in \R$, thet set of elements 
> $$

> * The convex sets $\{v\in V: \mu(v)<\alpha\}$ and $\{v\in V: \mu(v)>\alpha\}$ are called ***open half spaces***; 
> * The convex sets $\{v\in V: \mu(v)\leq \alpha\}$ and $\{v\in V: \mu(v)\ge\alpha\}$ are called ***closed half spaces***.
> Let $S\subseteq V$, a ***supporting hyperplane*** is a hyperplane $H$ such that $H\cap \pd S \neq \emptyset$ and $S$ is contained in  one of the closed half-spaces induced by $H$.

The following proposition is taken from https://www.imsc.res.in/~kesh/hahn.pdf with the premise that Hahn-Banach Theorem has already been proved in the form of semi-linear functional $p$. i.e., suppose $p$ is sub-linear and has homogenity for non-negative constant. When $W\subseteq V$ is a subspace, and $g:W\to \R$ satisfies $g\leq p$ on $W$, then $g$ can be extended to $f:V\to \R$ such that $f\leq p$ on $V$.

<proof>

***Sketch of Proof.*** 
* ($\Rightarrow$) Let $x\in C$, then by openness there will be $\epsilon>0$, $(1+\epsilon) x\in C$, therefore $p(x) \leq \frac{1}{1+\epsilon} < 1$. 

  ($\Leftarrow$) Conversely, if $p(x)<1$, we can choose $\frac{1}{t}$ approaching to $p(x)$ such that $\frac{1}{t}< 1$ and $ tx\in C$. Take $s=\frac{1}{t}$, then $s<1$ and $x/s\in C$, by convexity $s\cdot (x/s) + (1-s)0\in C$.

* "Scaling property" is straightfoward, for subadditivity observe that for any $\epsilon >0$ and $x,y\in V$,
  $$
    x':=\frac{x}{p(x)+\epsilon}\in C\quad \text{and}\quad  y':=\frac{y}{p(y)+\epsilon} \in C.
  $$
  Take $t=(p(x)+\epsilon )/(p(x)+p(y)+2\epsilon)$, we have 
  $$
  tx' + (1-t)y' = \frac{x+y}{p(x)+p(y)+2\epsilon} \in C,
  $$
  therefore $p(x+y)< p(x)+p(y)+2\epsilon$.

</proof>

>**Corollary.** Let $C$ be a nonempty open convex set in a real topological vector space $V$. Let $0\in C$ and $x_0\not\in C$, there is a linear functional $f:V\to \R$ such that $f(x_0) = 1$ and 
>$$
>x\in C \implies f(x)<1.
>$$

<proof>

***Proof.*** We keep using the same $p$ as the above proposition. Let $W = \R x_0$, define $g:W\to \R$ by $g(tx_0) = t$. For any $t>0$, since $\frac{1}{t} (tx_0)=x_0\not\in C$, by the proposition right above we have $ g(tx_0)=t\leq p(tx_0) $, therefore $g\leq p$ on $W$. This inequality also holds for $t<0$ since $p$ is always nonnegative. 

Therefore by Hahn-Banach Theorem we can extend $g:W\to \R$ to $f:V\to \R$ with $f\leq p$ on $V$. Hence if $x\in C$, by the proposition right above again we have 
$$
f(x) \leq p(x)<1 = g(x_0)=f(x_0).
$$

</proof>
 

Here comes our geometric version of Hahn-Banach Theorem by using this corollary:

>**Theorem (Hahn-Banach).** Let $A$ and $B$ with $A\cap B=\emptyset$ be two nonempty ***convex*** subsets of a real topological vector space $V$. 
> 1. Assume that $A$ is open. Then there is a closed hyperplane which separates $A$ and $B$, i.e., there is $\phi\in V^*$ and $\alpha\in \R$ such that 
>     $$
>     \phi(x)< \alpha \leq \phi(y)
>     $$
>     for all $x\in A$ and $y\in B$.
>
> 2.  Assume that $A$ is compact, $B$ is closed, and that $V$ is locally convex, then there are $\alpha,\beta\in \R$ and $\phi\in V^*$ such that 
>     $$
>     \phi(x) \leq \alpha< \beta \leq \phi(y)
>     $$
>     for all $x\in A$ and $y\in B$.

<proof>

***Proof of 1.***  Fix $a_0\in A$ and $b_0\in B$, define the set $C$ by 
$$
C = A-B+b_0-a_0,
$$
it is clear that $C$ is convex, $0\in C$ and that $C$ is open since $C=\bigcup_{b\in B}(A-b+b_0-a_0)$. 

Write $x_0=b_0-a_0$, then $x_0\not\in C$ (as $A\cap B=\emptyset$), we apply the corollary above to find a $\phi :V\to \R$ such that $\phi(x_0)=1$ and $\phi (x)<1$. Therefore for every $a\in A, b \in B$, 
$$
\phi(a-b+x_0) < 1 \iff \phi(a)-\phi(b)+ 1 < 1 \iff \phi(a)<\phi(b).
$$
We can therefore choose $\alpha =\inf_{b\in B} \phi(b)$ to conclude 
$
\phi(a)\leq \alpha \leq \phi(b)
$
for all $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. 

It remains to show that the leftmost inequality is strict. Assume not, i.e., there is an $a\in A$ such that $\phi(a) = \alpha$. Since $A$ is open, there is an $\epsilon>0$ such that $a+\epsilon x_0 \in A$. Then 
$$
\phi(a+\epsilon x_0) \leq  \alpha \iff \alpha +\epsilon \leq \alpha,
$$
which is absurd.

</proof>

<proof>

***Proof of 2.*** Now $A\subseteq V\setminus B$. Since $V\setminus B$ is open, for every $a\in A$ there is a convex neighborhood $U_a$ of $0$ such that $a+U_a\subseteq V\setminus B$. Since $\{a+\frac{1}{2}U_a\}\supseteq A$, by compactness, there are $a_1,\dots,a_n\in A$ so that $\{a+\frac{1}{2}U_a\}_{i=1}^n\supseteq A$. Take $U = \bigcap_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2} U_{a_i}$, we arrive to 
$$
A+U 
\subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^n \brac{ a_i + \frac{1}{2}U_{a_i} + U}
\subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^n \brac{a_i+U_{a_i}}
\subseteq V\setminus B.
$$
Now $A+U$ is an open convex subset disjoint from $B$, by 1) there are $\phi \in V^*$ and $\beta\in \R$ such that $\phi(a)< \beta \leq \phi(b)$ for all $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. Since $A$ is compact, so is $\phi(A)$, therefore we may take $\alpha=\sup \phi(A)$.

</proof>


>**Corollary.**  Suppose $C$ is a convex subset of a locally convex space $X$, then the weak closure of $C$ is the same as the original closure of $C$.

We introduce the notation $\olw{C}$ to denote weak closure and $\ol{C}$ the original closure.

<proof>

***Proof.*** One direction is trivial. To show that $\olw{C}\subseteq \ol{C}$, pick an $x_0\not\in \ol{C}$, we aim to show there is a weak neighborhood of $x_0$ that is disjoint from $\ol{C}$ (and thus $C$). To this end, apply the second part of Hahn-Banach theorem above, take $A=\{x_0\}$ and $B=\ol{C}$, then $A$ is compact and $B$ is closed, and we can find $\gamma\in \R$ and $\Lambda\in X^*$ so that $\Lambda(x_0) < \gamma < \Lambda(c)$ for all $c\in \ol{C}$. Now $U:=\{v:\Lambda(v)<\gamma\}$ defines a weak neighborhood of $x_0$ that is disjoint from $\ol{C}$ (and hence $C$), thus $x_0\not\in \olw{C}$.

</proof>

The following is known as ***Mazur's Lemma***, but it is a  direct consequence of the corollary above:

>**Theorem.** Suppose $X$ is a metrizable locally convex space, if $\{x_n\}$ in $X$ converges weakly to some $x\in X$, then there is a sequence $\{y_n\}$ in $X$ such that 
>* each $y_n$ is a convex combination of finitely many $x_n$'s and 
>* $y_n\to x$ originally.

<proof>

***Proof.*** Apply the corollary right above to the convex hull of $\{x_n\}$.

</proof>


> **Corollary.** Let $C\subseteq X$ be convex, then $C$ is norm closed if and only if $C$ is weakly sequentially closed.

<proof>

***Proof.*** Suppose $C$ is weakly sequentially closed. If $C\ni x_n\to x$, then $x_n \wto x$, but then $x\in C$, proving that $C$ is norm closed. Assume on the contrary that $C$ is norm closed, let $C\ni x_n \wto x$. By the previous theorem, $x$ will be a norm limit of some other $y_k = \sum \lambda_{ki}x_i \in C$, thus $x \in \ol{C} = C$, hence $C$ is also weakly sequentially closed. 

</proof>

>**Theorem (Characterization of lower semi-continuosu functions).** Let $X$ be a real normed space, a function $f:X\to \ol{\R}$ is lower semi-continuous if and only if its epigraph $\epi f$ is closed.


<proof>

***Proof.*** Suppose $f$ is lower semi-continuous, let $(x_0, a_0)\in \ol{\epi f}$, then there is a sequence $\{(x_n,a_n)\}$ in  $\epi f$ such that $(x_n,a_n)\to (x_0,a_0)$. Now $f(x_n)\leq a_n$, by taking $\limi$ on both sides we have 
$$
f(x_0)\leq \limi  f(x_n) \leq \limi a_n = a_0,
$$
therefore $(x_0,a_0)\in \epi f$, and thus $\epi f$ is closed. 

On the opp side suppose $\epi f$ is closed. Fix an $x_0\in V$, then for any $\epsilon >0$, we have $f(x_0)>f(x_0)-\epsilon=:M$. Therefore $(x_0,M)\not\in \epi f$. As $(V\times \R)\setminus \epi f$ is open, we can find open neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ and $\delta<\epsilon$ such that 
$$
(x, a) \in \underbrace{U\times (M-\delta,M+\delta)}_{\subseteq (V\times \R)\setminus \epi f}\implies f(x) > a > M-\delta>M-\epsilon = f(x_0)-2\epsilon.
$$
As this holds for any $x\in U$, we take $\limi$ on both sides to get $\limi_{x\to x_0} f(x)\ge f(x_0)-2\epsilon$.

</proof>


> **Corollary.** Let $f:X\to \ol \R$ be convex, then $f$ is lower semi-continuous if and only if it is weakly sequentially lower semi-continuous.

<proof>

***Proof.*** Observe that 
$$ 
\begin{aligned}
\text{$f$ is lower semi-continuous} 
& \iff \text{$\epi f$ is norm closed} \\
& \iff \text{$\epi f$ is weakly sequentially closed (by convexity of $\epi f$)}\\
& \iff \text{$f$ is weakly sequentially lower semi-continuous,}
\end{aligned}
$$
it remains to prove the last $\iff$. 

$(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose that $\epi f$ is weakly sequentially closed, let $x_n\wto x$ and passing to subsequence if necessary, let $x_n\to \limi f(x_n)$ as well, then $(x_n,f(x_n))\wto (x,\limi f(x_n))$. But $\epi f$ is weakly sequentially closed, therefore $(x,\limi f(x_n))\in \epi f$, i.e., $f(x)\leq \limi f(x_n)$, hence $f$ is weakly sequentially lower semi-continuous.

$(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose that $f$ is weakly sequentially lower semi-continuous. Let  $\epi f\ni (x_n,\alpha_n)\wto (x,\alpha)$, we want to show that $(x,\alpha)\in \epi f$. Observe that 
$$
(0, 1)\in X^*\times \R = (X\times \R)^*\implies \alpha_n\to \alpha,\\
\forall x^*\in X^*, (x^*,0)\in  X^*\times \R = (X\times \R)^* \implies \inner{x^*,x_n}\to x,
$$ 
therefore $x_n\wto x$ and $f(x_n)\leq \alpha_n,\forall n\implies \limi f(x_n)\leq \alpha$. By assumption, $f$ is weakly sequentially lower semi-continuous, therefore $f(x)\leq \alpha$, we conclude $\epi f$ is closed.

</proof>

> **Definition.** The largest lower semi-continuous minorant $\ol{f}$ of $f$ is said to be the ***lower semi-continuous regularization of*** $\bf{f}$.

**Remark.** Let $\{f_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a family of lower semi-continuous functions, then $f(x):=\sup_{i\in I} f_i(x)$ is also lower semi-continuous. Therefore  the largest lower semi-continuous minorant exists and the above definition makes sense.


>**Proposition.** If $f:V\to \ol {\R}$ and $\ol{f}$ is its lower semi-continuous regularization, there holds 
>$$
>\epi \ol{f} = \ol{\epi f} \quad \text{and}\quad 
>\ol  f(u)   =\limi_{v\to u} f(v).
>$$

<proof>

***Proof.***  By definition $f\ge \ol f$, therefore $\epi \ol f\supseteq \epi f$.  Since $\ol f$ is lower semi-continuous, $\epi \ol f$ is closed, therefore 
$\epi \ol f \supseteq \ol{\epi f}$.  

On the opposite side, by looking at the graph of $\ol{\epi f}$ we wish to find a  $g:V\to \ol{\R}$ such that $\epi g \xlongequal{(*)}\ol{\epi f}$, such $g$ can be explicited constructed by defining $g(x') = \limi_{x\to x'}f(x)$ for $x'\in V$. We first show  that the set equality $(*)$ holds for our choice of $g$.

Let $(x_0,a_0)\in \ol{\epi f}$, there are $\{(x_n,a_n)\}$ such that $x_n\to x_0, a_n\to a_0$, with $f(x_n)\leq a_n$. By taking $\limi$ on both sides, we have 
$$
g(x_0)= \limi_{x\to x_0} f(x)\leq \limi f(x_n)\leq \limi a_n = a_0,
$$
proving $\ol{\epi f}\subseteq \epi g$. Moreover, if there is $(x',a')\in \epi g\setminus \ol{\epi f}$, then there is an open neighborhood $U$ of $x'$ and $\delta>0$ such that $f(x) > a'+\delta$ for every $x\in U$. Since there is $\{x_n\}$ in $X\setminus \{x'\}$, $x_n\to x'$ and $f(x_n)\to \limi_{x\to x'} f(x) = g(x')$, it follows that 
$$
a'+\delta\leq \lim f(x_n) =g(x')\leq a',
$$
which is impossible. We conclude that $ \epi g=\ol{\epi f}$.

Now $g$ is lower semi-continuous (as its epigraph is closed), and $\ol{f}$ is the biggest minorant, $g\leq \ol f$, and thus $\ol{\epi f}=\epi g \supseteq \epi \ol f$, we have thereby shown that $\ol {\epi f} = \epi \ol f$. 

Since we have also shown that $\epi g = \epi \ol f$, it follows that $g=\ol f$ (why?).

</proof>




>**Theorem.** A lower semi-continuous convex function $f : V\to \ol{\R}$ equals the pointwise supremum of all its affine minorants.

<proof>

***Proof.*** If $f$ is a pointwise supremum of affine minorants, then $f$ is a lsc function that is convex.


Assume that $f$ is lsc and convex. If $f\equiv \infty$ then we are done. Suppose that $\dom f \neq \emptyset$. For every $x\in V$ and $a\in \R$ such that $a<f(x)$, we try to find an affine transform $S:V\to \R$ with $S\leq f$ on $V$ such that $a<S(x)<f(x)$, which thereby completes the proof. 


Lete $a_0<f(x_0)$, for some $a_0\in \R$ and $x_0\in X$, then $(x_0, a_0)\not\in \epi f$, therefore by Hahn-Banach theorem there is a $\Lambda \in (V\times \R)^*$ such that for some $\beta\in \R$, 
$$
\Lambda(x_0,a_0) < \beta < \Lambda (x,a) 
$$ 
for all $(x,a)\in \epi f$. We write $\Lambda = T \oplus \alpha$ for some $T\in V^*$ and $\alpha\in \R$, then we get 
$$
(*)\qquad \begin{aligned}
Tx_0 + \alpha a_0 &< \beta,\\
Tx + \alpha a &>\beta  \qquad \text{for $(x,a)\in \epi f$}.
\end{aligned}
$$
**Case 1 ($f(x_0)\neq \infty$).**
We choose $x=x_0$ and $a=f(x_0)+k$ for any $k\ge 0$, then subtracting these two inequalities gives
$$
\alpha(a_0 - f(x_0) - k) < 0,
$$ 
therefore by choosing $k$ big enough at the beginning, we must have $\alpha>0$. Now we set $a=f(x)$ and rearrange the above two inequalities in $(*)$  to get 
$$
a_0 < \frac{\beta}{\alpha} - \frac{1}{\alpha} Tx_0\quad \text{and}\quad \frac{\beta}{\alpha} - \frac{1}{\alpha} Tx < f(x)\quad \text{for all $x\in V$}.
$$
Thefore our affine functional $S(x) = \frac{\beta}{\alpha} - \frac{1}{\alpha} Tx$ will do.

**Case 2 ($f(x_0)=+\infty$).** In this case, if $\alpha \neq  0$, we note that $\alpha <0$ is impossible. Suppose that is the case, then the second inequality of $(*)$ will push $\beta$ to $-\infty$ (for $x\in \dom f$ we may take $a\to+\infty$), which is impossible.  Therefore $\alpha>0$ and we can still choose  $S(x) = \frac{\beta}{\alpha} - \frac{1}{\alpha} Tx$ and use the first inequality in $(*)$ to complete the proof.

Suppose now $\alpha= 0$. Then there holds from the second inequality of $(*)$, that for every $x\in \dom f$,
$$
 \psi(x):=\beta -Tx < 0.\tag*{($**$)}
$$ 
and that $\psi(x_0)>0$. Then we pick $x_1\in \dom f$, the point $(x_1, f(x_1)-1)\not\in \epi f$ and therefore by Hahn-Banach theorem again there is a $T'\in V^*,\alpha'\in \R$ and $\beta'\in \R$ such that 

$$
(***) \qquad 
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
T'x_1 + \alpha'(f(x_1)-1) &< \beta',\\
T'x + \alpha'a & > \beta' \quad \text{for  $(x,a)\in \epi f$.}
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
Put $x=x_1$ and $a=f(x_1)$, then subtracting these two inequalities we have $\alpha'>0$. On the other hand, if we set $a=f(x)$, then the second inequality of $(***)$ becomes 
$$
\frac{\beta'-T'x}{\alpha'}< f(x)\qquad \text{for all $x\in V$.}
$$
We can further conclude for any $k>0$, 
$$
\phi_k(x):=\frac{\beta'-T'x}{\alpha'} + k\cdot \psi(x) < f(x)\qquad \text{for all $x\in V$}
$$ 
since the inequality becomes trivial if $x\in V\setminus \dom f$, and surely holds for $x\in \dom f$ by $(**)$. Finally, since $\psi(x_0)>0$, we can choose $k$ large at the beginning such that $\phi_k(x_0) > a_0$.

</proof>

                                                                         
##### More on Properties of Convex Functions

The following are useful facts that are usually treated as exercises:

1.  If $f_1,\dots,f_n$ are proper convex functions ($f$ proper means $f>-\infty$ everywhere), then their ***infimal convolution***
    $$
      f(x):=\inf\limits_{x_1+\dots+x_n = x} (f_1(x_1)+\cdots + f_n(x_n)) 
    $$
    is also convex.

2.  If $f$ is convex, then so is $\dom f$.

3.  Let $f,g:X\to \ol{\R}$, if $\epi f = \epi g$, then $f=g$. 

    Because otherwise if $f(x)\neq g(x)$, let's say $f(x)>g(x)$, then $f(x)\leq g(x)$ becomes impossible, therefore $(x,g(x))\not\in \epi f=\epi g$, which by definition says that $g(x)<g(x)$, a contradiction.

4.  Let $f:\R\to \ol{\R}$ be convex, fix an $x_0\in \R$, then  
    $$
      \frac{f(x_0+\epsilon)-f(x_0)}{\epsilon}
    $$
    is an increasing function in $\epsilon$ on $\R\setminus \{0\}$. Similarly, if $f:\R^n\to \ol \R$ is convex, then for every $x\in \R^n$, the function 
    $$
      \frac{f(x_0+\epsilon x )-f(x_0)}{\epsilon}
    $$
    is also increasing in $\epsilon$ on $\R\setminus\{0\}$ as well. 
    
    The proof is simple, let $\epsilon_1<\epsilon_2$, then apply convexity to the points $\frac{\epsilon_1}{\epsilon_2}(x_0+\epsilon_2 x)$ and $(1-\frac{\epsilon_1}{\epsilon_2})x_0$.

5.  Let $f:V\to \ol\R$ be convex and $x_0\in V$, if $f(x_0)=-\infty$, then for every $x\in C$, 
    $$
    f(x+ \lambda(x_0-x))=-\infty \qquad \text{for all $\lambda\in (0,1]$.}
    $$
    Therefore if a convex function takes $-\infty$ at $x_0$, it causes every point in the straight line $[x_0,x)$ in $V$ to take $-\infty$ as well, where $x\in V$ and $[x_0,x)$ denotes a straight line connecting $x_0$ and $x$ with $x$ being excluded.

6.  Let $f:V\to \ol\R$ be convex and $x_0\in V$. Since $x_0 = \frac{1}{2} (x_0+ x) + \frac{1}{2} (x_0-x)$,  if 
    
    $$
    f|_{x_0+U} <\infty \qquad \text{for some $U$ a symmetric neighborhood of $0$},
    $$ 
    then by $f(x_0)\leq \frac{1}{2}f(x_0+x)+\frac{1}{2}f(x_0-x)$ it also holds that $f>-\infty$ on $x_0+U$. By property 5), <br/>
    $$
    f(x)>-\infty\qquad \text{for every $x\in V$},
    $$
    
    ***otherwise*** if $f(x)=-\infty$, then $f|_{[x,x_0)}\equiv-\infty$, which courses $f$ to take $-\infty$ at a point in $x_0+U$, a contradiction.
