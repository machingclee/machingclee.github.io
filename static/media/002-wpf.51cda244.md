#### Motivation
I have been a hard-core player in Granblue Fantasy and Final Fantasy 14 (currently still an active player). Their popular feature is the rich story with their own gigantic world, but unfortunately none of them have content available in Chinese.

This serves as a motivation for me to create an application that: Without interrupting the gameflow, users can save each screenshot, can go back and review the content of each page, jot down their dictionary, and categorize their screenshots by "note":

#### Result

<center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GM1Ec79vlG8" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen ></iframe>
<p/>
</center>

Users can save their dictionaries for review. And they can capture the text from screenshot by the tool I developed in the previous project, which is already integrated into this application. The whole application is created by WPF in .net framework and recently has been transited into .net-core 3.
