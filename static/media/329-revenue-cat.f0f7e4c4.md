#### Step up an Revenue Cat Account

1. Create an account in [Revenue Cat](https://www.revenuecat.com/)

2. Create a project in revenue cat

3. Inside of the project, create ios/android application with desired name and

4. Click the application and start to setup inapp purchases in your mobile app

#### InApp Purchase Easy Mode (iOS)

##### iOS: Revenue Cat Setting

Relative to android, iOS is much more straight forward and simple. Let's go through the following one by one:

![](/assets/img/2024-10-21-00-08-14.png)

###### App Store Connect App-Specific Shared Secret

Refer to [Official Documentation](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret)

###### In-app purchase key configuration

Refer to [Official Documentation](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret/in-app-purchase-key-configuration)

###### Apple and Apple Store Connect API

Refer to [Official Documentation](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret/app-store-connect-api-key-configuration)

###### Get the Public ApiKey

Click `save changes`, an `ApiKey` can be obtained from

![](/assets/img/2024-10-21-00-48-55.png)

With this key we can fetch all our products and subscription list once configuration in app store connect is done.

##### iOS: App Store Connect Setting

###### Go to Susbcription Page and Mange Subscription Group

Click on Subscriptions:

![](/assets/img/2024-10-21-00-23-00.png)

Click on Subscription Groups and create a group (of subscriptions):

![](/assets/img/2024-10-21-00-23-29.png)

###### Create Subscription Plans

Inside of the subscription group manage all your plans (weekly, monthly, yearly, etc). A user will be able to subscribe **_only one_** of them at one period:

![](/assets/img/2024-10-21-00-25-23.png)

###### Order Subscription Plans for Upgrade and Downgrade

Note that subscription plans have a notion of "upgrade" and "downgrade", be sure to read this instruction:

![](/assets/img/2024-10-21-00-29-24.png)

- Superior plan should be placed on top of inferior plans.
- In this way apple knows how to organize payment (upgrade should pay immediately with cost calculated with proration, and downgrade should be scheduled at the end of billing period).

###### Return to Revenue Cat to Manage the Subscriptions

After the subscription list is all set, go back to revenue cat and import the product list:

![](/assets/img/2024-10-21-00-34-28.png)

###### Offerings: the Logical Group of Subscriptions (Subset of a Subscription Group in App Store Connect)

Let's go to offerings and create a group of subscriptions that users can purchase (**_only one subscription_** can be active at a period)

An offering usually looks:

![](/assets/img/2024-10-21-00-38-22.png)

Users can choose which plan they want.

- In short, "offerings" is a logical group of available choices of which you can only choose one.

- And for sure they must be inside of the **_same subscription group_** in app store connect.

###### NPM Package to get all the Subscriptions

Now attach the `APIKEY` in your app and you are set to fetch the subscriptions! Since we are using react-native, we will be discussing how to get the list via revenue-cat's [`react-native-purchases-ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-purchases-ui)

#### InApp Purchase Hard Mode (Android)

##### Android: Revenue Cat Setting

Play console will be another long story.

Compared to app store connect, we just need to provide one credentials JSON of your _service account_ (explain later). But getting this `JSON` and getting the mobile build to fetch data successfully will be a bit harder.

##### Android: Google Play Console

##### Bounce Between Google Cloud Platform, Revenue Cat and Google Play Console

First we need to strictly follow [this official documentation](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/service-credentials/creating-play-service-credentials), this will include:

- **1.** Enable the Google Developer and Reporting API (GCP)

- **2.** Create a Service Account (GCP), download the **_credential json_** of this account

- **3.** Grant this service account (Play Console) the permissions
- **4.** Paste the credential into revenue cat

- **5.** Upload signed .aab file in both this page:

  ![](/assets/img/2024-10-21-01-47-56.png)

  where you will be redirected to **_Closed Testing_**. Note that the offical docoumentation is out-dated, you are not able to upload apk.

  If you have uploaded an `.aab` file before, you can simply choose `add from library`:

  ![](/assets/img/2024-10-21-01-49-50.png)

- **6.** Update the tester list:

  ![](/assets/img/2024-10-21-01-56-19.png)

- **7.** Release the internal test, non-dev tester can only test your inapp-purchase via this internal test build. Upon successful submission (no review needed), you will be given an **_URL_**. Share it to android testers, they will be redirected to a hidden page in playstore to download the app.

##### Expo Evil Detail for Android Development Build

- Our local development build must also be signed with the same `app-signing-key` used in the `.abb` we just uploaded/selected. Therefore it is beneficial to us to store the `app-signing-key` locally.

- In `eas.json`, set `build.dev.android.credentialsSource = "local"`.

- `expo run` does not allow `--profile`, but it reads `development`/`dev` profile automatically in `eas.json`

  **Remark.** `expo run` does read `eas.json` (not just by eas-build in the cloud)

- Development build **_cannot be in debug mode_**, set

  ```json
  { "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleRelease" }
  ```

  in `dev` profile of `eas.json`

  **Remark 1.** Otherwise (in debug mode) we get ErrorCode: ITEM_UNAVAILABLE ([reference](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-flutter/issues/93) from flutter developer)

  **Remark 2.** Hot-reload is still available, we can keep developing in `release` mode

#### React-Native Part

##### Get all Packages

```js
const fetchPackages = async () => {
    try {
        dispatch(appSlice.actions.setLoading({ open: true, showOverlay: true }))
        const offerings = await Purchases.getOfferings()
        if (offerings.current !== null && offerings.current.availablePackages.length !== 0) {
            setAvailablePackages(offerings.current.availablePackages)
            console.log("offerings.current.availablePackages.length", offerings.current.availablePackages.length)
        }
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err)
    }
}
```
##### Get a Monthly Plan

```js
const monthlyHandyPackage = packages.find((package_) => {
    const productIdentifier = package_.productIdentifier
    const isHandyBillie = isHandyRegex.test(productIdentifier)
    const isMonthly = package_.rawPackage.packageType === "MONTHLY"
    return isHandyBillie && isMonthly
})
```
##### Get a Annual Plan

```js
const yearlyHandyPackage = packages.find((package_) => {
    const productIdentifier = package_.productIdentifier
    const isHandyBillie = isHandyRegex.test(productIdentifier)
    const isYearly = package_.rawPackage.packageType === "ANNUAL"
    return isHandyBillie && isYearly
})
```
##### Subscribe a Plan
```js
const subscribeItem = async (package: PurchasesPackage, period: Period) => {
    if (package && period) {
        dispatch(appSlice.actions.setLoading({ open: true, showOverlay: true }))
        try {
            const { customerInfo } = await Purchases.purchasePackage(package)
            const { originalAppUserId } = customerInfo
            const platform = (() => {
                if (Platform.OS === "ios") {
                    return MobilePlatform.IOS
                } else if (Platform.OS === "android") {
                    return MobilePlatform.ANDROID
                } else {
                    throw new Error("Only ios and android platform are supported.")
                }
            })()
            // keep a record in our own backend
            dispatch(SeatThunkAction.paymentSucceeded({ period, platform, originalAppUserId }))
        } catch (err) {
            console.log(err)
        } finally {
            dispatch(appSlice.actions.setLoading({ open: false }))
        }
    }
}
```
