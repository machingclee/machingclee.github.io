```ts
// useRerender.ts

import { ReactNode, useState } from "react";

export default () => {
  const [rerenderFlag, setRerenderFlag] = useState(true);
  const rerender = () => {
    setRerenderFlag(false);
    setTimeout(() => setRerenderFlag(true), 1);
  };

  const Rerender = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
    return <>{rerenderFlag && children}</>;
  };

  return { rerender, Rerender };
};
```

The trick is simply executing `setRerenderFlag(true)` later by letting it execute in `callback-queue`, such a callback is created by `setTimeout` and it will be executed once every task in the call stack are cleared.

For example, what would be the result of the following?

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("I come from timeout");
}, 1);

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  console.log("I come from for loop");
}
```

Why is that? A very clear explanation can be found in:

Understanding how `v8` works can essentially help investigate how `nodejs` works, and after that we can appreciate how single-threaded model can handle high concurrency problem.

Similar idea can be brought to other languages like `Java`, and from that we are lead to the use of `WebFlux` in the realm of reactive programming.

The word **_single-threaded_** may be "misleading" as `nodejs` is not always single-threaded, but the main thread will not be blocked by designating some tasks to other thread like DNS-resolution or file io (which inevitably blocks!).
