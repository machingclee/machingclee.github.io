#### Duplicated Data

Assume that a translation table has a column `messageId` and a column `createdAt`. Which accidentally has more than one records:

```text
messageId   createdAt           translation
123         1600000000000       I am James
123         1700000000000       I am James
123         1800000000000       I am James
321         1750000000000       Hi James
321         1850000000000       Hi James, nice to meet you
```

We want to reduce these group of records into simply one, let's say only the latest one:

```text
messageId   createdAt           translation
123         1800000000000       I am James
321         1850000000000       Hi James, nice to meet you
```

Here is how we do it easily:

#### SQL Script to Remove Duplicated Records

```sql{3,4}
delete from "MessageTranslation" where id not in (
	-- all translation that is latest among dulicated message
	select distinct on ("messageId") "MessageTranslation".id from "MessageTranslation"
    order by "MessageTranslation"."messageId", "MessageTranslation"."createdAt" desc
)
```

- The highlighted lines represent the `id`'s of translation record that is latest among the set of messages having the same `messageId`.

  **_Reason._**

  - We first order the results by `messageId`
  - next we further order them by `createdAt desc`
  - finally we `select distinct on ("messageId")` to select the **_first occurence_** of results "grouped by" the `order by` clause.

- Finally we have selected desired results, we delete those that are not desired.
