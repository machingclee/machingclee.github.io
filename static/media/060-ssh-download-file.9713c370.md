#### SSH Into a Computer

Given that I have following following config in `~/.ssh/config`

```text
Host gp
  HostName 12.34.567.89
  User cclee
  Port 1314
```

Then I can ssh into this computer by

```text
ssh gp
```

and inputting the password.

#### SSH into an EC2 Instance

With EC2 we additionally need a private key. In both Windows (with git-bash) and unix-based system, we can use that key in `.pem` format.

```text
Host uat
  HostName ec2-some-number.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com
  User ubuntu
  Port 22
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile C:\keys\wbkeypair-tokyo-james.pem

Host prd
  HostName ec2-some-other-number.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com
  User ubuntu
  Port 22
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile C:\keys\wbkeypair-tokyo-james.pem
```

#### Download a File in SSH Client

##### With ~/.ssh/config

Suppose that we have identified the filepath to download, we can

```text
scp gp:/the/file/path /local/file/path
```

and we will be done by typing the password in console.

##### Without ~/.ssh/config

```text
scp -P port-number user@domain:/destination source-file/directory
```
