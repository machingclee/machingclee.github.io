The source code, as of 4th August 2022, has not been released by any one, therefore I was responsible to implement such a model on my own using all the evidence provided by the defectGAN paper, which are basically everything inside reference section. 

#### Results

The interpretation of the results:

##### Rows

- **First Row.** Synthesize image by transforming the image from defective to normal.
- **Second Row.** Synthesize image by transforming the image from normal into defective.
- **Third Row.** A random segmentation that is never trained on that image before, this to test generalization.
##### Columns
- **First Column.** Either image with defect or without defect.
- **Second Column.** Defect Segmentation.
- **Third Column.** Top layer defect generated which is to be overlayed on the normal image.
- **Fourth Column.** Defect segmentation generated by the network which is to determine how much-synthesized defect is to be overlayed onto the normal image.
- **Fifth Column.** An image is created by entrywise multiplication (here mask is a matrix with values clipped within $[0,1]$)
$$
\text{[Generated Defect]}\times\text{mask} + \text{[Normal]} \times (1-\text{mask})
$$
