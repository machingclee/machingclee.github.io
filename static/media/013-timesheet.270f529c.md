- PGSQL and its Schema: (using camel case for column name is just my hobby, I realize it is not conventionally correct)

#### Tech Stack

|Tech|Reason|
|---|---|
|Next.js |Love the file-based router, deployed as a vercel.app|
|Express.js|Simple backend|
|Lambda Functions|It's cheap, rather than spending 3x USD/month for low number of requests using ec2 or fargate|
|Prisma|For schema migration only, removed in deployment as it's huge|
|PostgreSQL|With prisma we have flexible schema-migration. I have been using MongoDB for a long while and get used to PGSQL recently, even use it in personal project|
|PGSQL Service Provider| Neon-Tech, it doesn't charge you until you exceed its limit of time for resource computation, love it for POC project|
|Kysely|For query builder|

#### Why this Project?

##### Background


- This project is to ***provide a timetable system*** for a group of ***4 or 8*** players of Final Fantasy XIV to:

  - Fill in their available timeslots within a week so that,

    - All 4 or 8 people of the group can join an event, or

    - leader can arrange substitution for that week as early as possible.


- For example, 8 people raiding for an ***ultimate dungeon*** in FF14 have to commit 4~6 days per week with 2 hours per day to join the raiding group for practice, e.g.,

##### Problems to Solve

- ***Time arrangement is always an headache***, each group ***uses different strategies*** to confirm available timeslots for each of 8 members, for example:

  - **Case 1.**

    ![](/assets/img/2024-02-18-18-08-00.png)

  - **Case 2.**

    ![](/assets/img/2024-02-18-18-08-41.png)
  
  - **Case 3.** 
    
    ![](/assets/img/2024-02-18-18-08-49.png)

    - In case 3 there is a Japanese member, therefore HKT must be specified.

    - As FFXIV is a game full of people with ***diversified*** national background, such method is confusing for players of ***different timezones***.
