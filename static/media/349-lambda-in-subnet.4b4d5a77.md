#### Overview

#### Strategy

##### Resource to be protected

Place our protect resourced (target lambda function) behind **internal** load balancer.

##### Endow lambda functions with security group

Place our public-facing lambda functions into private subnet so that:

- the lambda function can be endowed with an ENI (Elastic Network Interface)
- that ENI can carry a security group (SG) so that **_now lambda function can carry an SG_**.

##### Calling protected resourcess

###### Public facing lambdas

Since our protected lambda function $\lambda_\text{protected}$ stay behind internal load balancer, suppose that the load balancer has an DNS name:

- `my-internal-loadbalancer`

then inside of private subneted lambda function $\lambda_\text{private\_subnetted}$, calling $\lambda_\text{protected}$ is as simple as calling

- Make a request to `http://my-internal-loadbalancer:<port-number>/suitable/route`
- Allow SG to access port `port-number`

here we assume that our lambda function is acting like a web server.

###### Public facing ECS services

For ECS since by default each service already has an SG, by allowing this SG to access `port-number`, we get access to protected resource easily.

#### How to Connect a Lambda Function to a VPC and then a private subnet

##### VPC configuration in Lambda Functions Console

1. Go to your lambda function and choose `Configruation > VPC`

    <img src="/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-29-46.png" width="400"/>
    <p></p>

2. Choose a VPC, then choose an `AZ` and hence a private subnet

   ![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-29-55.png)

   Finally Choose an SG and congradulation! Our lambda has an SG now!

##### Caveat of connecting lambdas to a VPC/subnet
###### Outbound Traffics are Lost
- By default each lambda function **_cannot make any request from inside_** when they are connected to a VPC (due to security reason).
###### Connect Lambda Functions to Public or Private Subnet?
- It makes no difference using public or private subnet to place our lambda functions.
###### Cloudwatch log Becomes Unavailable
- **_Cloudwatch log endpoint connection is also lost_** in this scenario. For logging purpose, one should always add `VPC endpoints` to this private subnet.

  ![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-31-12.png)

  upon clicking `create endpoint`, you will need to choose

  |   Option    | Value                                                                                                                                                 |
  | ------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `Type`           | AWS Service                                                                                                                                            |
  | `Services`       | com.amazonaws.your-region.logs                                                                                                                         |
  | `VPC`            | Your target  VPC                                                                                               |
  | `Subnet`         | Your target private subnet                                                                                                                             |
  | `Security Group` | SG in this context means the group of resources that is available to this endpoint, not related to any security inbound or outbound rules |

#### Create Necessary Resources

##### Create subnets and what are the available CIDR blocks?

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-31-49.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-31-49.png)

By default the following are available:

```text
172.30.0.0/20 (0-15)   ← existing
172.30.16.0/20 (16-31) ← existing
172.30.32.0/20 (32-47) ← existing
172.30.48.0/20 (48-63) ← you can use this
172.30.64.0/20 (64-79) ← or this
```

For example `172.31.64.0/24` will be a good choice, which means that any resource created in this subnet has a flexible choices of $2^8 = 256$ private addresses.

If we want to further subdivide `172.31.64.0/24` into 3 pieces, we can use:

```texthttps://www.facebook.com/groups/
├── Subnet 1: 172.31.64.0/28 (first 16 IPs)
├── Subnet 2: 172.31.64.16/28 (next 16 IPs)
├── Subnet 3: 172.31.64.32/28 (next 16 IPs)
...and so on
```

##### Set up NAT gateway

###### Create an NAT Gateway

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-10.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-10.png)

1. Arbitrary Name
2. Any **_Public Subnet_**
3. Must be of **_Public Connectivity Type_**
4. Must **_have an Elastic IP_** (which we have at most 5 for each region)

###### Associate to a subnet by creating route tables

First create a route table:

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-27.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-27.png)

Next view the detail of the route table, edit it and add `0.0.0.0/0 <- nat-xxxx`.

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-34.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-34.png)

Finally associate **_all private subnets_** for which you wish to apply the route table:

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-40.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-40.png)

##### Setup private subnet and internal load balancers

###### Subnets and Route Table

By default the creation of load-balancer requires **_at least two private subnets_** in two separate AZ's

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-47.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-47.png)

Next our private subnets need outwards traffic, create a route table for this purpose:

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-52.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-52.png)

and of course we add outward traffic rules

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-59.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-32-59.png)

for the new private subsets:

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-08.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-08.png)

###### Internal load balancer

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-13.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-13.png)

Choose Internal Type with IPv4 addresses:

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-22.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-22.png)

Then choose two of the private subnets:

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-28.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-28.png)

Choose the identity (SG) for your lobalancer:

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-41.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-41.png)

And finally add the listeners and target groups:

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-48.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-48.png)

##### Internet-facing load balancers

Same as the previous one, but you need add your load balancer at public subnets and for listeners you need to asscoiate it a **_certificate_**.

##### VPC endpoints (for cloudwatch)

Go to `VPC > Endpoints` create your end points with appropriate service name:

[![](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-54.png)](/assets/img/2024-12-21-17-33-54.png)

For Cloudwatch we need `com.amazonaws.<region-name>.logs`.

Other service endpoints that reuqired an endpoint in privatee subnet:

- S3 Gateway Endpoint (Free)
- DynamoDB Gateway Endpoint (Free)

In our case if we want to get access to our **_internal load-balancer_**, **_no endpoint_** is needed.
