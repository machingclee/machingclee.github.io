We will make use of the following repository:
- https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Download

Go to any folder that contains your `your.pdf` file, open the shell in that directory and

- In windows, run:
  ```bash
  export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 && docker run -ti --rm -v "$(pwd)":/pdf bwits/pdf2htmlex pdf2htmlEX --zoom 1.3 /pdf/your.pdf
  ```
- In mac, run:
  ```bash
  docker run -ti --rm -v "$(pwd)":/pdf bwits/pdf2htmlex pdf2htmlEX --zoom 1.3 /pdf/your.pdf
  ```

Here `export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` is to prevent our `git-bash` to auto-convert windows path `$(pwd)` into a path that starts with `C:/Program Files/...`

An example from my YOLOv3 Study notes in the past:
