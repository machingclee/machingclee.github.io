#### For Missing Signboards

Our `json` file will be of the form:

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "image_source_path": "/home/raspect/nas1/tmp/joe/tmp/i8y6v_yn/P202203252_516_3098.jpg",
      "file_name": "2022_1st_trip02_reannotation/P202203252_516_3098.jpg",
      "width": 4176,
      "height": 2784,
      "classifications": []
    }
  ],
  "annotations": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "image_id": 1,
      "bbox": [1858, 1912, 683, 217],
      "segmentation": [],
      "iscrowd": 0,
      "category_id": 1,
      "classifications": [],
      "score": 0.857421875
    }
  ],
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "signboard"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `image_source_path` is not used by CVAT, it is the path we can copy from gp1 computer to na0.
- `file_name` is the field used by CVAT, it is the path of the images relative to the volume mount to the CVAT's docker image.
- This json will be run inside gp1 computer to do the copying process (using `image_source_path`).
- So this json file serve two purpose.

#### For Missing Defects

##### Json Format

This time we will be using the 7 defect annotations used by the training team. They are:

- `damaged_display`
- `seg_damaged_display`
- `rust`
- `derelict`
- `deformed_structure`
- `frame`
- `hangout_bar`

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "image_source_path": "/home/raspect/nas1/tmp/joe/tmp/7e2uen4a/P202204066_2088_12538.jpg",
      "file_name": "2022_1st_trip06_defect_annotation/P202204066_2088_12538.jpg",
      "width": 4176,
      "height": 2784,
      "classifications": []
    }
  ],
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "damaged_display"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "seg_damaged_display"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "rust"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "name": "derelict"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "name": "deformed_structure"
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "name": "frame"
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "name": "hangout_bar"
    }
  ]
}
```

This time we don't need to provide `annotations` attribute.

##### Finding the Hash Before Image Name

As you may notice in `image_source_path`

```none
/home/raspect/nas1/tmp/joe/tmp/i8y6v_yn/P202203252_516_3098.jpg
```

there is an hash `i8y6v_yn` which cannot be queried in the database, therefore we need to connect to

```none
gp1:/home/raspect/Workspaces/tai/ai-master/release/python/
```

change the config in `gen_coco.py` to target trip, and run:

```python
pyenv activate torch && python gen_coco.py
```

The resulting json will contain the full path of the original image (which starts with `/home`), and we get the hash.
