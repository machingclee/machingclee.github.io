intro: Record the flow of loading opencv into CMake project.

#### Windows

##### OpenCV

- In the [official guide](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d3/d52/tutorial_windows_install.html) we can download the pre-built library, for example, we choose 4.6.0 and download the exe file

  <Center>
  <img src="/assets/tech/125/001.png" width="600"/>
  </Center>
  <p></p>
  <center></center>

  By running this `.exe` file we can decompress and extract files into a single folder that follows this structure:

  <Center>
  <img src="/assets/tech/125/002.png" width="600"/>
  </Center>
  <p></p>
  <center></center>

  As a routine I will save all libraries like `opencv`, `libtorch` and `boost`, etc, into a folder called `C++Library`. These libraries will be shared among different projects.

- Next in the root level `CMakelists.txt` we include

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
  set(CPACK_PROJECT_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME})
  set(CPACK_PROJECT_VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION})
  set(OpenCV_DIR "C:\\Users\\user\\Repos\\C++Libraries\\opencv\\build\\x64\\vc16")
  find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)
  message(STATUS "OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS = ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}")
  message(STATUS "OpenCV_LIBS = ${OpenCV_LIBS}")
  ```

  Change the path for `OpenCV_DIR` when needed.

- Then we can use
  ```cmake
  target_link_libraries(some_target PUBLIC ... ${OpenCV_LIBS} ...)
  ```
  to link the library when the project needs it.

##### libtorch

- We can download the libtorch pre-built library from official pytorch website. The structure is like this:

  <Center>
  <img src="/assets/tech/125/003.png" width="600"/>
  </Center>
  <p></p>
  <center></center>

- In the root level `CMakeLists.txt` we include

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "C:\\Users\\user\\Repos\\C++Libraries\\libtorch")
  find_package(Torch REQUIRED)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${TORCH_CXX_FLAGS}")
  if (MSVC)
    message("copying dll files")
    file(GLOB TORCH_DLLS "${TORCH_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/*.dll")
    add_custom_command(TARGET EyeCatching
                      POST_BUILD
                      COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
                      ${TORCH_DLLS}
                      $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:EyeCatching>)
  endif (MSVC)
  ```

- Then we can link the library by

  ```cmake
  target_link_libraries(some_target PUBLIC ... ${TORCH_LIBRARIES} ...)
  ```

#### Mac

##### OpenCV\_

We install opencv directly by homebrew:

```text
brew install opencv
```

Then the pre-built library can be found in `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/opencv/`. It remains to link it in our cmake project.

The cmake instruction remains the same as windows, in my case my path to the libary is `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/opencv/4.7.0_1`.

##### libtorch\_

We can still download pre-built libtorch library in official pytorch website. The cmake instruction remains the same as windows.
