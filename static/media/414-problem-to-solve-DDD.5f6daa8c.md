#### Problems of Controller-Service-Repository (CSR) Architecture



In the course of development several backend problems in CSR-architecture pop up easily that I always feel painful:

<Example>

**Problem 1 (Not easy to have clear separation of responsibility among services).**  From CSR point of view, a service is just an interface to handle a  request, and *nothing more*, that causes the problem.

As time goes by, developer is easy to build *multiple services* serving a similar purpose. 

Suppose I have a project system, now I want to design a service to let project owner add someone as a member. You can go either way:

- `ProjectService.addMember`

- `MemberService.joinProject`

There is no true or false among the choices, but our domain logic now *can go anywhere*, or even *repeatedly defined* like the `join-project` example above. 

</Example>

<Example>

**Problem 2.1 (Side Effects Become a Mess).** When dealing with side effects, namely:
- Some change in a table will cause other events to happen, such as another change in another table or sending notification, etc.

The only way the CSR-architecture can handle it is to add the handling of extra logics at the end or even at the middle of *ALL existing related services*.  Problems arise:

- First, the Open-Closed principle is easy to break and maintaining this chain of side effects is exhausting. 

- Second, this kind of side effect is *not easy to be documented*, the domain logic involved is hard to be traced and hard to be understood by new team members trying to participate in adjusting that domain logic.

</Example>


Worse still:

<Example>

**Problem 2.2 (Side Effect can be Transactional).** There are two kinds of side effects:

- Atomic

- Non-atomic

Do you want the whole successful transaction be ruined and rollbacked by the failure of sending an email notification? 

It is not trivial to implement a "transactional" side effect (e.g., send the email only when a transaction has been commited), especially when that side effect is dispatched in the middle of a chain of transaction script.

</Example>

#### How does DDD help?

##### Define Aggregates to avoid Spreading of Domain Logic

Both problem can be easily solved by the methodology in DDD. 

- **For problem 1 (Spread of Domain Logic)**, we handle all the state change from the domain behaviour of an aggregate root. We do all the data modification within the same ***consistency boundary***. 

  If we want to kick a member out of a project, let's fetch the project, and execute 
  ```kotlin
  project.kickMember(member)
  ```
  it is ***impossible*** to do it in the reverse way: `member.leave(project)`, because `member` does not contain enough information to do ***domain logic validation*** (which we call ***invariance*** in DDD). 
  
  For example, assume a project cannot have fewer than 3 persons. A single member does not contain the information of other members, however, a project *does*, which is possible to keep the invariance within itself.


##### Define Policies for Side Effects Using Even Driven Architecture
###### Overview


- **For problem 2 (Messy Side Effect)**, we simply use an event-driven architecture, and DDD is inherently based on ***events***.  DDD's `Command` and `Event` are a good fit for handling side effects.

  - To solve problem 2.1, the tight coupling of logic can now be decoupled by event and event-handler. 

  - To solve problem 2.2, using JPA from the ecosystem of Spring Boot,  atomic side effect can be handled by 
    `@Eventlistener`, and side effect after succeeded transaction can now be handled by `@TransactionalEventListener`.

  Event-Driven architecture can also be a mess ***without documentation*** because `eventHandler` handles the side effect silently. However, if we do documentation properly, then ***everything is explicit***:


  [![](/assets/img/2025-09-06-18-44-57.png)](/assets/img/2025-09-06-18-44-57.png)

  Now we have a good place to record the complex domain requirement. 
  
  We discuss how we operate with these `Command`, `Event` and `Policy` in my portfolio article: 
  - [Commercial Timetable System for an Art School](/portfolio/Commercial-Timetable-System-for-an-Art-School)

  via section *Coding Example of Command-Event System*.


###### Coding Exmaple

```kotlin
@Component
class NoClassCanExceedPackageExpiryDatePolicy(
    private val studpackageRepository: StudentPackageRepository,
    private val entityManager: EntityManager,
) {

    @EventListener
    fun validatgePackageExpiryDateOn(event: TimetableDomainEvent.ClassesCreatedEvent) {
        entityManager.flush()
        validatePackageExpiryDate(event.packageId)
    }

    @EventListener
    fun validatgePackageExpiryDateOn(event: TimetableDomainEvent.ClassMovedEvent) {
        entityManager.flush()
        validatePackageExpiryDate(event.packageId)
    }

    @EventListener
    fun validatgePackageExpiryDateOn(event: TimetableDomainEvent.ClassDuplicatedEvent) {
        entityManager.flush()
        validatePackageExpiryDate(event.packageId)
    }

    @EventListener
    fun validatgePackageExpiryDateOn(event: TimetableDomainEvent.ClassesExtendedEvent) {
        entityManager.flush()
        validatePackageExpiryDate(event.packageId)

    }

    @EventListener
    fun validatgePackageExpiryDateOn(event: TimetableDomainEvent.StudentPackageUpdatedEvent) {
        entityManager.flush()
        val packageId = event.originalPackage.id!!
        validatePackageExpiryDate(packageId)
    }

    private fun validatePackageExpiryDate(packageId: Int) {
        entityManager.flush()
        val pkg = studpackageRepository.findByIdFetchingClasses(packageId)
        if (pkg?.expiryDate != null) {
            // Use a direct query to get the maximum hour timestamp without loading all class entities
            val latestClasses = pkg.classes.sortedByDescending { it.hourUnixTimestamp }.first()
            val latestTimestamp = latestClasses.hourUnixTimestamp.toLong()

            if (latestTimestamp > (pkg.toDTO()?.expiryDate ?: 0).toLong()!!) {
                throw TimetableException("Class cannot exceed package expiry date, this class exceeded expiry date: ${latestClasses.toDTO()}}")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

###### Advantages

From the coding example above we have seen that:

1. All constraints (invariances) related to the expiry date have been consistently handled in the same file.

2. Each side effect after an event is ***decoupled*** from the logic of the work flow where this event is dispatched.

3. Each side effect is handled by a reusable logic, at the same time, they are readily "customized" because they are handled by separate listeners. 

    We don't need to worry about adjusting the reused function would make undesired bug to other event listener.
