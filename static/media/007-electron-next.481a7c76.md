#### Repository
- Private, personal use only.

#### Motivation

As Final Fantasy 14 has recently launched a new patch of huge update, which means a rich content of new story has been added --- a good chance to learn Japanese from conversation between characters.

Essentially this software is a complete remake of my previous project that is done using WPF, rediving into that project is time-consuming. Writing UI in XAML file (in WPF) is not that straight foward compared to writing UI in html and css.

#### Result

I have prepared this software for about 1 week before the update of the game using Electron and Nextjs when I am off my work of my full-time job.

I have also made a page Japanese Study to serve the data generated by my software, so that I can review, search the word I want, jump into that "conversation" and screenshot directly at home or at office!

I was surprised to the productivity I have using web technology to produce desktop application. The journey of developing and using this software is joyful. I have made a script to decompress images and export all the dictionary data to a json file.
