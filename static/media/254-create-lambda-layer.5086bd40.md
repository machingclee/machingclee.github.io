- Note that `aws-xray-sdk` is not a natively supported package in lambda.

- Let's create a layer in order to make `aws-xray-sdk` importable into our lambda function in python.

- Make sure we have conda installed, and put 
  ```text
  source ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
  ```
  in our `~/.bashrc`, this is to make sure `conda` is identifiable as a executable command.

1. Open an empty folder and `cd` into it

2. `pip install -t $(pwd) aws-xray-sdk`

3. Create a new folder named `python`, drag all package related files into it, and zip that `python` folder

4. Go to Layers and click `Create Layer`

5. Upload the `zip` file and we are ready to go.

6. Test the import statement which originally throwed error without our additional layer:

    ```python
    import json
    from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        # TODO implement
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps('Hello from Lambda!')
        }
    ```
