#### Methametical Definition

For each $c\in \mathbb C$, define $f_c(z)=z^2+c$, we say that $c$ is in a  ***Mandelbrot set*** if the sequence 
$$
\{(\underbrace{f_c\circ\cdots\circ f_c}_\text{$n$ times})(0)\}
$$
is bounded, which is the same as saying the seqeunce of complex numbers defined by $z_{n+1} = f_c(z_n)$ is bounded with $z_0 := f_c(0)$. 


#### Coding

Since we have a sequential definition, in coding which is the same as saying

```rust
let mut z = Complex { re: 0.0, im: 0.0 };

for i in 0..n {
  z = z * z + c
}
```
is bounded for however large $n$.


##### Preliminary Functions

###### Crates

```rust
use image::codecs::png::PngEncoder;
use image::{ExtendedColorType, ImageEncoder, ImageError};
use num::Complex;
use std::fs::File;
use std::time::Instant;
```

###### ecape_time


```rust
fn escape_time(c: Complex<f64>, limit: usize) -> Option<usize> {
    let mut z = Complex { re: 0.0, im: 0.0 };
    for i in 0..limit {
        if z.norm_sqr() > 4.0 {
            return Some(i);
        }
        z = z * z + c
    }
    None
}
```

A theorem in fractal analysis says that 

>  **Theorem.** A point $c\in \mathbb C$ belongs to the Mandelbrot set if and only if $|z_n|\leq 2$ for all $n \ge 0$.

To plot the graph of Mandelbrot set, it is enough to loop through a set of points in a complex plane and for each point $c\in \mathbb C$ we consider it as a point in Mandelbrot set if `let mut z = c;`, `z = z * z + c;` has norm smaller than 2 for each of 255 loops. If it is bigger than 2 for some iteration, we end the loop.

```rust

    complex_plane_lower_right: Complex<f64>,
) -> Complex<f64> {
    let complex_plane_width = complex_plane_lower_right.re - complex_plane_upper_left.re;
    let compelx_palne_height = complex_plane_upper_left.im - complex_plane_lower_right.im;
    let pixel_img_width = pixel_img_dim.0 as f64;
    let pixel_img_height = pixel_img_dim.1 as f64;
    let new_re = complex_plane_upper_left.re
        + (pixel_coordinate.0 as f64) * complex_plane_width / pixel_img_width;
    let new_im = complex_plane_lower_right.im
        + (pixel_img_height - pixel_coordinate.1 as f64) * compelx_palne_height / pixel_img_height;
