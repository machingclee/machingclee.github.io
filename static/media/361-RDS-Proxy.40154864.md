#### Security Groups

We create two security groups:

- `Lambda-SG`
- `RDS-SG`

As in the diagram indicated:
- The `RDS-SG` accpets inbound traffic from `Lambda-SG`. 
- `RDS-SG` again accepts inbound traffic from `RDS-SG`.
The main challenge is to figure out the appropriate permissions for `RDS-Proxy` to connect to `RDS` and that for  `Lambda` (inside of a VPC) to get access to the `RDS` service.



#### Connect RDS and RDS-Proxy From Lambda Functions
##### Permissions to Lambda for RDS and RDS-Proxy Connection
```js
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "rds-db:connect",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:rds-db:ap-southeast-2:798404461798:dbuser:prx-0226dec8098d1321d/*"
},
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "rds:DescribeDBProxies",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:rds:ap-southeast-2:798404461798:db-proxy:prx-0226dec8098d1321d"
},
```
These two are all we need to connect to `rds` and `rds-proxy`. 
- Here `798404461798` is our `AWS Account ID` (viewable at the top right corner) and 
- We can find our `proxy-id` here:

##### Permission to Lambda for VPC Assignment

The following
```js
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
    "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
    "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```
allows a lambda function to be connected to a VPC network because it enables us to create ***Elastic Network Interface*** in order to assign security group to a lambda function.

More detail on Lambda Functions and VPC can be found in [this article on architecture of private lambda functions](/blog/article/Architecture-for-Private-Lamdba-functions-called-via-another-lambda-function).



#### RDS-Proxy

##### Methods to Connect RDS

RDS-Proxy can get access to our RDS instance in either way:
- Get credential from secrets manager
- Authenticate by IAM-Role
We choose to use secret manager because we don't need to introduce `aws-sdk` (language specific) for new approach of connecting to our DB. That is, if we created a new proxy-endpoint, we simply use it as if it is a usual endpoint.

We need to remark that RDS-Proxy endpoint is a `VPC`-bounded resource. We are ***not able*** to connect to it outside of the VPC unless we create additional proxy mechanism, e.g., via EC2 instances.

Nevertheless enabling RDS-Proxy ***does not mean*** deleting our original RDS endpoint, we can use both as we please.

##### Permissions for RDS-Proxy

Edit the IAM-Role of the RDS-Proxy instance and add:

```js{11}
{
    "Sid": "GetSecretValue",
    "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy",
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",
        "secretsmanager:ListSecretVersionIds"
    ],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:ap-southeast-2:798404461798:secret:billie-uat-rds-proxy-corrected-nMKcow"
    ]
},
```
Here `secret:billie-uat-rds-proxy-corrected-nMKcow` is the ***secret id***. If we change to use other secret for RDS-Proxy, then we need to adjust the permission here as well.
```js
{
    "Sid": "DecryptSecretValue",
    "Action": [
        "kms:Decrypt"
    ],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:kms:ap-southeast-2:798404461798:key/154ed61c-114f-4fd5-9434-e2761190506d"
    ],
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "kms:ViaService": "secretsmanager.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com"
        }
    }
},
```
This `DecryptSecretValue` is auto-generated, and finally
```js
{
    "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetRandomPassword",
        "secretsmanager:ListSecrets"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}
```

#### VPC Endpoints for RDS

Since RDS is one of the `endpoint` resources in AWS (other example is `cloudwatch`), accessing an `endpoint` is as simple as:
1. Adding this endpoint to the private subnet ***of lambda functions***

    ![](/assets/img/2025-01-14-02-32-34.png)

    and;
2. Assigning a security group to that endpoint to identify which group of resources is available to use that endpoint

#### Connection to RDS-Proxy

Finally, we simply replace the RDS endpoint by RDS-Proxy endpoint and we are done!
