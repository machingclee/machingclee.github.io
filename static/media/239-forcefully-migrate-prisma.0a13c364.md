#### Procedures

- Sometimes we don't want prisma to notice the changes in migration file as we have done some adjustment ***manually*** (and make the corresponding changes in migration file as well so that it automatically migrates to production).



- Run   to the target migration:
  ```text
  shasum -a 256 prisma/migrations/20220510001642_my_migration/migration.sql
  ```


- This will produce something like:
  ```text
  fc27e97b9a61877f7f59d59a69c8c0bd2cd3271bc44b9f208800ed458d18a10b  prisma/migrations/20220510001642_my_migration/migration.sql
  ```
- Update the database of target row with `checksum` column with the hash:  
  ```text
  fc27e97b9a61877f7f59d59a69c8c0bd2cd3271bc44b9f208800ed458d18a10b
  ```

  ![](/assets/img/2024-02-26-01-00-33.png)

- Then `yarn migrate` should have no warning such as:
  ```text
  The migration `20240219084746_constraint_admin_to_invite_people` was modified after it was applied.
  We need to reset the "public" schema at "ep-aged-morning-26453078.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech"

  Do you want to continue? All data will be lost.
  ```
  which is of course ***NO***!
