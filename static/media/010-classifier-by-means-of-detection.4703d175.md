#### Repository
- We use faster rcnn with Resnet-50 as backbone and use FPN architecture, the model is exactly the same as below with the training data being kept confidential:
  https://github.com/machingclee/Minimal-Code-for-Faster-RCNN-with-FPN-in-pytorch

#### Task Discription
I was responsible to implement an algorithm to classify the defect type, if any, of a cropped signboard. The signboards are detected and cropped by a yolo algorithm, so I am left with implementing a classifier.

- **First Attempt.** We build a naive binary classifier that intakes an image and output a score of being a rusty signboards, however we face two problems using this approach:
  1. There are not enough images of rusty signboard. In fact, there is very slim chance of finding a rusty signboard in a trip view.
  2. We don't know what is learned by the network, worse still, we have no control on what to learn.

<p/>

- **Second Attempt.** We have not enough rusty signboard images, but we relatively large amount of  rust within an image, therefore we use object detection and the classification score of **faster rcnn** of each detection boxes to define rust score. 

  Denote 
  $$
  \{b_1,b_2,\dots, b_n\}
  $$
  the rust detection boxes and 
  $$
  \{s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n\}
  $$ 
  the corresponding rust classification scores, a signboard is defined to be **rusty** if 
  $$
    \text{there is a signboard with cls score } \ge 0.6 \iff \max_{i=1,2,\dots, n} s_i \ge 0.6,
  $$
  where the rusty-score threshold 0.6 is based on the evaluation of the model performance. It will change over time and is not fixed.

#### Results 
Interpretations of the Images:
- Green boxes are ground truths
- Blue boxes are predictions with the cls score attached right above
