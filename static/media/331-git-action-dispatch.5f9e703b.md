intro: We can design a button to determine what and when to do something instead of automating the actions for each push / merge request.

#### Workflow Dispatch Menu

##### String, Dropdown List and Boolean

```yml
---
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      tag:
        type: string
        description: "Release tag (e.g., v1.0.0)"
        required: true
        default: v1.0.0
      boolean:
        type: boolean
        description: True or False
      servicename:
        type: choice
        description: Make a choice
        options:
          - foo
          - bar
          - baz
```

#### Work with inputs from workflow_dispatch

##### Retrieve the value

We get the value in shell script via

```yml
run: echo ${{ github.event.inputs.tag }}
```

##### Determine whether a step should be run (Like a Mapping)

The following can be treated as a "mapping" to determine which parameter to use if we have made a reusable github action. A typical example is a javascript action because all of them must be reusable by nature, see [Fundamentals of Github Actions](/blog/article/Fundamentals-of-Github-Actions) and scroll to _Javascript Actions_ section.

- For unknown reason the expression `${{ github.event.inputs.servicename == 'foo' }}` does not work because the available expression syntax is limited to specific functions and operators
- Instead we use:

  - ```yml
    if: contains(github.event.inputs.servicename, 'foo')
    ```
    or
  - ```yml
    if: github.event.inputs.servicename == 'foo'
    ```

- More examples from [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idif)

```yml{12,19}
jobs:
  test:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
    - name: "Checkout source code"
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
          fetch-depth: 0

  foo-service:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: always() && github.event.inputs.servicename == 'foo'
    steps:
    - name: "Checkout source code"
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

  bar-service:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: always() && github.event.inputs.servicename == 'bar'
    steps:
    - name: "Checkout source code"
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

Note that we add `always()` because the previous step may **_partially_** succeed for unknown reason but we still want to continue.

Note that the subsequent jobs will not continue unless you have

- `if: success()` or
- `if: failure()`

etc expression.

##### Validate tha inputs from workflow_dispatch

For example, we can enforce the tag to follow some specific pattern:

```yml
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check trigger type
        id: check-trigger
        run: |
          if ! [[ ${{ github.event.inputs.tag }} =~ ^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$ ]]; then
            echo "Tag must follow format v*.*.* (e.g., v1.0.0)"
            exit 1
          fi
  deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: deployment
    ...
```

##### Add Tag to a branch Using Value from workflow_dispatch

Suppose that we have input a `tag` and want to tag a branch once a deployment succeeded, we add a final step to a job:

```yml![alt text](image.png)
      # ... other step
      - name: Create tag
        run: |
          # Print current branch for verification
          echo "Current branch: $(git branch --show-current)"

          # Create tag on current branch
          git tag ${{ github.event.inputs.tag }} ${{ github.ref_name }}
          git push origin ${{ github.event.inputs.tag }}

          echo "Created tag ${{ github.event.inputs.tag }} on branch ${{ github.ref_name }}"
```
