#### Why this Project?


When there are many projects opened at the same time, finding and switching between them is a nightmare. Especially when I need to switch to different IDE and different project by SourceTree.



#### Decision between `Egui`, `Tauri` and `Iced`


##### `Iced` 

The official website of iced is linked [***here***](https://iced.rs/).

My first attemp to GUI application in rust starts with Iced:

- [2025-10-13-Iced-gui-experiment](https://github.com/machingclee/2025-10-13-Iced-gui-experiment)

To me `Iced` has the following disadvantages:

1. `Iced` is ***nice*** for the philosophy of mutating any application state by messages. But it is also ***bad*** in the sense that every tiny little UI state change must be processed by a message.

2. The variety of UI-components in `Iced` is relatively limited compared to other frameworks, a simple and standard component such as "context-menu" is even not a built-in component in the framework.


3. It is a relatively ***young*** framework.  Its first stable version was released in 2022.


##### `Tauri`


As a full-stack developer in web I am already very used to `React`. 

However, when there are two languages involved (such as `Qt` we use `js` for `QML` and `C++` in backend) there is hardly the possibility of sharing type interfaces to both sides of the project.


Unlike `Electron` we can use typescript on both sides, when it comes to fetching data from the backend, unsharable type-interfaces also lead to maintenance cost of syncing the interfaces in typescript and rust for data deserialization.

`Tauri` would complexify the application when there is ***no need*** for sophisticated UI that we benefits from webviews.






##### Why `egui` stands out


I personally prefer `egui` for the following reasons when I make the study:

- [Rich UI components and Rich Documentation (click me)](https://www.egui.rs/)

  [![](/assets/img/2025-10-26-14-19-40.png)](/assets/img/2025-10-26-14-19-40.png)



- Easy to learn, we copy the code from [official website](https://www.egui.rs/) ***for whatever component*** we want and start implementing our own logic.

- ***Same language*** in frontend and backend, enjoyable experience for the communication between frontend and backend.


- Rust has built-in channel-and-message mechanism, making the ***Domain Driven Design***  easy to implement. Therefore we have clear separation of concerns by defining:

  - **Commands.** Only command can trigger backend/system state change.
  - **Event.** Only event can trigger UI state change
  - And each completion of a command will dispatch one or more events.
