#### Motivation
Having created my project II below on windows presentation foundation, I have decided to learn how to build mobile application in order to view my screenshots and vocabularies, etc, on mobile so that I can read them everywhere. I have deployed two ec2 instances, with one running a docker container of a mySQL server and one running a docker container of my Spring-Hibernate application

#### Result

Users can save their dictionaries for review. And they can capture the text from screenshot by the tool I developed in the previous project, which is already integrated into this application. The whole application is created by WPF in .net framework and recently has been transited into .net-core 3.
