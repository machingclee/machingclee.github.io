#### tensorflow-gpu, cudatoolkit and cuDNN

First scroll down the to bottom of <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows?hl=zh-tw">this page</a> to get a list of compatible version of tensorflow-gpu, cuDNN and CUDA.

For me I have been using tensorflow-gpu 2.4.0, cuDNN 8.x and cuda 11.x. We can:

- Install tensorflow-gpu 2.4.0 by `pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.4.0`.
- Install cudatoolkit 11.0 by `conda install cudatoolkit==11.0`.
- Download cuDNN 8.4.0 from <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download#a-collapse805-110">here</a>. Copy the files from
  - `downloaded\cuDNN8.4.0\{bin, include, lib}`
    into
  - `C:\Users\<name>\anaconda3\envs\<env name>\Library\{bin, include, lib}`
    respectively.

#### Possible error: zlibwapi.dll

When running script with tensorflow, the program may raise the following error:

```text
Could not locate zlibwapi.dll
```

To solve it we following the instruction from sectoin **_3.1.3. Installing zlib_** from <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html#install-zlib-windows">here</a>.

#### Indication of Running Tensorflow with GPU Successfully

The following messages should be logged in our console when we are running a script with tensorflow imported.
