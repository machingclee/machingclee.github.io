#### Concurrency

##### Unreserved Concurrency

- Free for all functions in $\displaystyle \frac{\text{account}}{\text{region}}$.

- If one function concumes all concurrency, the others will get throttled.

##### Reserved Concurrency

- This is the **_number of containers_** allowed to run concurrently for a specific lambda function.

- This number is taken away from the unreserved concurrency pool.

- You can use reserved concurrency to **_minimize_** or **_maximize_** the processing rate.

- By default, the maximum number of concurrency is set to 1000, but that **_doesn't mean_** you are allowed to spawn 1000 containers by default.

- By default my applied account-level quota value **_is just 10_**.

- To get the maximum number of concurrency we need to request it from:

- Go to `Monitor` > `Throttles`, which counts the number of function invokation that is beyond the concurrency limit. If it is **not** intentionally done to rate limit an api endpoint, then **any positive value is an alarm**.

  For experiment, in this picture we have 3 counts beyond the `concurrency limit` (which is set to be 0).

- We can also monitor the number of **concurrent execution** to adjust the configuration of max number of concurrency:

##### Provisioned Concurrency

- As with reserved concurrency, it also subtracts from unreserved concurrency pool.

- It is a pool of concurrency that is **always on** (for optimal latency).

- Very **Expensive**.

- It supports autoscaling group policies.

#### Database Proxies for RDS

- Lambda functions are executed inside a container, and when concurrency reaches to some level, the database is unable to handle large amount of concurrent requests for new connections

- RDS-Proxy helps minimize the number of requests for new connections unless it is necessary:

#### CloudWatch Events with Lambda

- Choose `CloudWatch` and then choose `Rules`:

  ![](/assets/img/2024-04-05-02-08-06.png)

- Give it a name and choose `Schedule`, we will be redirected to EventBridge Scheduler page:

  ![](/assets/img/2024-04-05-02-09-16.png)

- Choose `Recurring schedule` and we are led to define a `cron expression`:

- A list of templates and experiments on the `cron expression`:

  - https://crontab.guru/

- Choose Lambda Invokation as a target and complete the invokation payload:
