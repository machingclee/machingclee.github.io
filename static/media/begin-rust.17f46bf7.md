#### Book

#### Installation Guide

https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html

#### Commands

- Create new project:
  ```text
  cargo new begin-rust
  ```
- Install new packages (called crates in rust): Find desired package from https://crates.io/crates, copy `rand = "0.8.5"` below [`dependencies]

  ```text
  [package]
  name = "begin-rust"
  version = "0.1.0"
  edition = "2021"

  [dependencies]
  rand = "0.8.5"
  ```

  and then run `cargo build`

#### How to Solve 'Z' is only accepted on the nightly compiler

This is because we need toolchain of nightly version, for this:

```text
rustup install nightly
```

and then use

```text
rustup show
```

to show all downloaded toolchain, finally,

```text
rustup default nightly
```

to change the default version we use.
