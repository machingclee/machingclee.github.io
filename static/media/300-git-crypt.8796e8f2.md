intro: "Sometimes it is much more convenient to save multiple config files in a repository than to git-ignore it. We study the encrpytion of those files using git-crypt."

There are multiple reasons for encrpyting important files in order not to expose it to other people. Let's follow the following step:

#### On your Machine (before pushing to existing directory)

1.  Let's install `git-crypt`. 
    - ***For windows*** just copy the executable from [**this repository**](https://github.com/oholovko/git-crypt-windows) into 
      ```text
      C:\Program Files\Git\cmd
      ```
    - ***For Mac*** just run `brew install git-crypt`.

2.  Create a `.gitattributes` in your working repository, then write for example:
    ```text
    serverless.yml filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
    ```
    which usually contains import secrets.

3. Run `git-crypt init` to initiate the encrpytion config.

4.  Run `git-crypt status` to check which files get encrypted. In my case:
    ```text{3}
    ...
    not encrypted: backend/server.ts
        encrypted: backend/serverless.yml
    not encrypted: backend/service/authService.ts
    ...
    ```
5. The encryption only takes place when we git commit.

6.  Since someone in your team needs to credential, let's create a key for decrpytion:
    ```text
    git-crypt export-key ./git-crypt-key
    ```

7. ***Make sure*** to add `git-crypt-key` to `.gitignore`

8. Now push the code to the repository.

#### From Other Machine

1. Pull the repository.

2. Send the `git-crypt-key` file to people you trust.

3. Run `git-crypt unlock ./git-crypt-key` in the working directory.

4. Now files  get decrpyted, and the decryption will be automatic for every `git pull`.
