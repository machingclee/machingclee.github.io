#### Lessons from the Implementation

We record the implementation of the ThreadPool in the next section. For this section, we record several encountered errors and methods to get around them.

##### Box, Rc\<T\> | Weak\<T\>, RefCell\<T\>, Mutex\<T\>, Arc\<t\>

- `Box<dyn T>`
  - **_Single thread only_**
  - Help save data on heap instead of memory
  - Checked in compile time
- `Rc<T> | Weak<T>`
  - **_Reference Count Type_**
  - Checked in compile time
  - Used in **_single thread only_**
  - Created by `let a = Rc:new(data)`
  - Cloned by `Rc::clone(&a)`
  - `a` above is immutable
  - Used when multiple reference is needed
  - **_Mainly_** used as immutable reference
  - Combined with `RefCell<T>`, we can implement **_interior mutability_**
  - `Rc<T>.downgrade()` and `Rc<T>.upgrade()` can switch a reference to weak and strong respectively
  - (cont'd) Used when there is a recursive relation that has parent-children relationship
  - `weak_reference_count` wouldn't affect the release of resource as long as the `strong_reference_count` of a variable goes to `0`
- `RefCell<T>`

  - **_Reference Cell Type_**
  - Only checked in runtime
  - Used in **_single thread only_**
  - Can be used in mutable and immutable reference
  - Let `let a = Rc::new(RefCell(4))`, then `a` is immutable
  - But `a.borrow_mut()` can create a mutable reference
  - (cont'd) After destructured, `*a.borrow_mut() += 10` becomes valid
  - **Example (Interior Mutability).**

    ```rust
    // a should have been immutable,
    let a = Rc::new(RefCell::new(123));
    // but with RefCell::new, the data become mutable by using .borrow_mut()
    let b = Rc::new(&a);
    *b.borrow_mut() += 1000;
    print!("{:?}, {:?}", a, b);

    // print:
    // RefCell { value: 1123 }, RefCell { value: 1123 }
    ```

  - Some comments in the internet suggest avoiding interior mutability when possible
  - An immutable ereference can be created by `a.borrow()`

- `Mutex<T>`
  - Used in **_multi-threaded scenario_**
  - Used when internal state of the object of type `T` can change in different thread, this is to avoid data race
  - Need `Mutex<T>.lock.unwrap()` to get the lock and gain right to access and mutate the value
- `Arc<T>`
  - Used in **_multi-threaded scenario_**
  - **_Thread-safe_** and **_multi-threaded version_** of `Rc<T>`, can be referenced by many threads
  - A stands for **atomic**
  - **Example.** Suppose that a single `receiver:  Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Message>>>` is passed to 10 threads:
    ```rust
    let message: Message = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv().unwrap();
    ```
    We will be using module `mpsc` (multi-producer, single-consumer) to get `Sender` and `Receiver`

##### Access Struct's Field but Encounter: does not implement the Copy trait Error

We consider the following exmaple:

```rust
struct Foo {
    bar: Bar,
}

impl Foo {
    fn foo(&self) {
        self.bar.bar();
    }
}

struct Bar {}

impl Bar {
    fn bar(self) {}
}

fn main() {
    let foo = Foo { bar: Bar {} };
    foo.foo();
}
```

By `cargo check` we get

```text
93 |  let bar = self.bar;
   |            ^^^^^^^^
   |            |
   |            move occurs because `self.bar` has type `Bar`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |            help: consider borrowing here: `&self.bar`
```

###### Reason of the Problem

The problem is that `fn Bar.bar` takes the ownership of the `Bar` instance (the `self.bar`). If `self.bar.bar()` were executable, then `self.bar` will be release **_accidentally_** after the execution of that function is finished, which is disastrous and should be forbiddened.

###### Solution: Universal Trick by using Option\<T\>

In other words, `self.bar` must be taken away **_intentionally_** in order to be fed into `.bar` method. The universal trick is to make `self.bar` be of type `Option<T>`, then

```rust
(self.bar as Option<T>).take()
```

can take away **_both_** the ownership and the value of `self.bar` and set `self.bar` to `None`:

```rust
...
struct Foo {
    bar: Option<Bar>,
}

impl Foo {
    fn foo(&mut self) {
        if let Some(bar) = self.bar.take() {
            bar.bar();
        }
    }
}
...
```

Note that because `self.bar` is mutated (as `self.bar` becomes `Option::None`), we need `foo(&mut self)` instead of `foo(&self)`.

<center></center>

**Possible Scenario.**
The problem discusses above occur occasionally. For example, if our struct contains a field named `thread: thread::JoinHandle<()>`, and if we want to execute `thread.join()`, then because the signature of `.join` is:

```rust
pub fn join(self) -> Result<T>
```

we must take out the `thread` intentionally by chaning the type of the field `thread` from type `thread::JoinHandle<()>` to `Option<thread::JoinHandle<()>>`.
