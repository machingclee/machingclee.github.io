#### Prerequisite

We assume the reader has installed the npm package `serverless` globally. Make sure you can run `sls` or `serverless` at your terminal.

#### Python Flask

##### Template Repo

- https://github.com/machingclee/2023-07-22-serverless-python-template

##### How to test Locally and Deploy

- `yarn` to install `serverless-wsgi` and `serverless-python-requirements`

- Now if you run `sls wsgi serve`, a flask api server should be up and running. It also provides hot reload for code changes.

- After your api implement are done, you can `sls deploy` to deploy your application.

- You can `sls remove` to undo everything.

##### Size Reduction for Python Lambdas

You can reduce the size by modifying `serverless.yml`.

- Add `custom.pythonRequirements.noDeploy`.

- By default `serverless` will copy compiled binary from your virtual environment.

- If you add `autopep8` in `noDeploy`, make sure to remove that from `requirements.txt` as well because `serverless` will make a copy of `requirements.txt` and copy compiled binary accordingly.

- `dockerizePip: true` is necessary for package `PILLOW` because the compiled binary in windows is not compatible with linux.

- Layers! I haven't tried to Flask yet, we may add `noDeploy` in the list once we find suitable lambda layers available in our region:

  ```text
  provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.8
  layers:
    - arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:xxxxxxxxxxxxx:layer:xxxxx:mylayer1
    - arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:xxxxxxxxxxxxx:layer:xxxxx:mylayer2
  ```

  The list of layers available at our region can be found in [here](https://github.com/keithrozario/Klayers/tree/master/deployments/python3.8).

#### Nodejs Express (ts)

##### Template Repo

- https://github.com/machingclee/2023-07-23-severless-express-ts-template

##### How to test Locally and Deploy

- `yarn` to install

  - `serverless-http`
  - `serverless-offline`
  - `serverless-plugin-common-excludes`
  - `serverless-plugin-typescript-express`

- To run locally we run `yarn start`, which just use traditional `nodemon` and `ts-node src/app.ts`.
- We run `yarn deploy` to deploy our app using our `~/.aws` credentials.
- We run `yarn remove` to `sls remove` everything according to cloudformation record.

##### Size Reduction for Nodejs Lambdas

Compared to python we have much fewer things to modify in `serverless.yml` as we don't have such options. The best thing we may try is:

```yml
package:
  patterns:
    - src/** # include only files from ./src/**/*
    - "!node_modules/some-package/**" # exclude files from ./node_modules/some-package/**/*
```

and add `layers` in provider option, but I don't have such convenient resource yet.

##### Manual Bug Fix before Deployment

Before deployment, a manual bug fix must be held on our own. From [this thread](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/10944), we need to modify

```none
node_modules/serverless/bin/serverless.js
```

which in my case my `serverless.js` is held at the following absolute path

```none
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Yarn\Data\global\node_modules\serverless\bin\serverless.js
```

in that file we add the following line right after `use strict;`:

```js
require("../../graceful-fs/graceful-fs").gracefulify(require("fs"));
```
