#### Root Cause of Dangling ENIs

Assume that a function has been assigned a VPC config using a security group id `sg_id` and private subnet ids `[subnet_id_1, subnet_id_2,subnet_id_3]`, then a dangling ENI happens when we **_delete the lambda function directly_**.

#### Correct Procedure to Delete a Lambda Function

##### Case 1. Lambda is created from cloudformation stack

- Delete the cloudfromation stack.

- Make sure to empty the S3 bucket first because the deletion of cloudformation stack does not help us empty the bucket, causing a failure in the deletion process.

##### Case 2. Otherwise

- **_Step 1._** Remove the VPC configuration
- **_Step 2._** Wait until AWS asynchronously deletes the ENI given that:

  - **Rule 1.** All published versions `:n` for $n\in\mathbb N$ that have VPC configuration **_are deleted_**

  - **Rule 2.** The latest version `$:latest` has no VPC configuration

  Violation of either one of the rules will prevent AWS from releasing the ENI, keeping the ENI in `in-use` state and undeletable.

No matter a function is in case 1 or case 2, we can remove the ENI in the following manner:

##### Unified approach to delete ENI by keeping only the lambda functions\:latest

Assume that we are going to destroy the entire VPC (including its resources), at some point we will be blocked by dangling ENIs. Now we delete and update functions that are using those ENIs.

First we borrow a script from AWS official repository[^official-repo-aws]:

[^official-repo-aws]: `cd` into `Lambda/FindEniMappings/` of [aws-support-tools](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-support-tools.git)

###### Step 1: Find all functions that are using the ENI

- We create a file called: `findEniAssociations` (see the code detail in footnote[^awsscript], no file extension here).

[^awsscript]:
    Shell script to get a list of lambda functions using the target ENI:

    if [ $? -ne 0 ]
    then
    echo "The json parsing package 'jq' is required to run this script, please install it before continuing"
    exit 1
    fi

    set -e #fail if any of our subcommands fail
    printf "This script is for determining why an ENI that is managed by AWS Lambda has not been deleted.\n\n"

    # take the region and the ENI id as parameters

- Now we execute

  ```bash
  ./findEniAssociations --eni eni-03a2b666d92cdfd13 --region ap-southeast-2

  to get a list of functions using this ENI. In my case I get the following:

  ```

  **Remark 1.** Any function with an integer `:n` is considered as a **_published version_**.

  **Remark 2.** To delete the ENI, we need to delete all published versions and update `:latest` version to remove all security id and subnet ids.

###### Step 2: Remove and update lambda functions using the list of functions just obtained in step 1

- Having obtained a list of functions using the ENI, we use the the **_python script_**[^remove-old-and-update-latest] to do the following processes:

  - Delete the published version
  - Update the latest version into _no VPC config_.

[^remove-old-and-update-latest]:
    Python script to delete the published lambda functions and update the latest lambda function:

#### Oh my Gosh! I Deleted a Lambda Function Accidentally, Causing a Dangling ENI

##### Recovery Strategy

Our strategy is to create a **_placeholder function_** with exactly the same

- `function-name`
- `sg_id`
- `subnet_id`'s.

Being of the same `sg_id` and `subnet_id`'s will prompt AWS to reuse the same ENI.

Now removing the VPC config of the lambda function (can be by console or `aws-cli`) will trigger the ENI removal (when no published version is using the ENI) by AWS[^aws-doc].

[^aws-doc]:
    [Official documention](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html#configuration-vpc-enis) states that

    > When you update a function to remove its VPC configuration, Lambda requires up to 20 minutes to delete the attached Hyperplane ENI. Lambda only deletes the ENI if no other function (or published function version) is using that Hyperplane ENI.

##### Steps to restore the deleted function by a placeholder funciton

1. Create an `index.js`:

   ```js
   exports.handler = async (event) => {
     return { statusCode: 200, body: "OK" };
   };
   ```

2. zip the file by `zip function.zip index.js`

3. Randomly pick a role, and create a function with desired `sg_id` and `subnet_id`'s:

   ```bash
   aws lambda create-function \
     --function-name target-function-name \
     --runtime nodejs18.x \
     --role arn:aws:iam::798404461798:role/<random-role> \
     --handler index.handler \
     --zip-file fileb://function.zip \
     --vpc-config "{\"SubnetIds\": [\"subnet_id_1\", \"subnet_id_2\", \"subnet_id_3\"], \"SecurityGroupIds\": [\"sg_id\"]}"
   ```

4. Delete the VPC config in aws console to trigger the ENI removal.

After 5-10 minutes the ENI will change its state from `in-use` to `Available`, now we are free to delete them.
