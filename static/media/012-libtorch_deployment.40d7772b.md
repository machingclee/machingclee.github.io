title: "Translate Pytorch Model and Weight into Libtorch Model for C++ Project"
intro: This project attempts to apply weights trained from pytorch (Python) model to libtorch (C++) model by constructing the same model structure.

#### Technical Detail

I have recorded all the detail needed for the translation in

- [Libtorch Study Notes With OpenCV](/blog/article/Libtorch-Study-Notes-With-OpenCV)

This inclues:

1. How to register modules;

2. How to validate the libtorch model is compatible with the pytorch model;

3. Simple usage of opencv (in C++) that is helpful to migrate from `numpy`.

#### Main Value of This Translation Project:

- This project is a **complete C++ translation** of [mediapipe's blazeface in this repository](https://github.com/zmurez/MediaPipePyTorch) written in python.

- We build the **same model architecture** in libtorch in order to reconstruct the same structure as in the pytorch model.

- Therefore we can apply the **weight trained from pytorch** and
- Directly deploy the model in our C++ project.

This libtorch model is to be integrated into the desktop application:

which is still in ongoing state.
