intro: "Fix the error of failing to find source files when it really can for cmake projects."
---

Sometimes soruce file cannot be found even cmake tool can build the project successfully, this is because an incorrect configuration provider is set, we can fix it by `F1` and

```text
>C++: Change Configuration Provider
```

and choose `cmake tool`. Which essentially modifies `.vscode/settings.json` and sets

```text
"C_Cpp.default.configurationProvider": "ms-vscode.cmake-tools"
```
