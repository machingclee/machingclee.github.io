When taking elevator one is possible to calculate the probability of being the first one to leave the lift. 

In my situation, assume that:
* An elevator can just stop from floor $22$ to floor $40$.
* Infinite capacity.
* We start from ground floor.

Given that I will leave at floor $n$, where $22\leq n < 40$, then the average probability of taking the first leave at floor $n$ is $\displaystyle \frac{1}{n-21}.$

**Reason.** Denote $E_k$, $k\ge 2$, the event that floor $n$ is the first one to stop with $k$ buttons on the elevator control panel being pressed. 

We discard the case $k=1$ as $\mathbb P(E_1)=1$ is too big that  pollutes our average value.

We have (for $k\ge 2$)
$$
\mathbb P(E_k) =\displaystyle \binom{40-n}{k-1} \bigg/\binom{18}{k-1}.
$$

* Note that we are just considering choosing $k-1$ buttons because floor $n$ being the first to stop has conditioned our sample space to combintations of selected buttons that contain $n$. 

* Here the numerator $\binom{40-n}{k-1}$ represents the combinations of buttons that is bigger than $n$. 

* The demoninator $\binom{18}{k-1}$ represents the available combinations of buttons apart from $n$.


Note that the edge case of $k$ is $k=2$ and $k= |\mathbb N \cap [n, 40]|=40-n +1$. Our average probability will be
$$
\frac{1}{\underbrace{40-n+1-2+1}_{\text{number of summands}}}
\sum_{k=2}^{40-n+1} \mathbb P(E_k) = \frac{1}{40-n}
\sum_{k=2}^{41-n} \frac{\displaystyle \binom{40-n}{k-1}}{\displaystyle \binom{18}{k-1}} \xlongequal{(*)}\frac{1}{n-21}.
$$ 

Here $(*)$ follows from the following lemma:

> **Lemma.** Let $X, Y$ be positive integers and $X\leq Y$, then 
> $$
> \sum_{k=1}^X \frac{\binom{X}{k}}{\binom{Y}{k}} = \frac{X}{Y-X+1}.
> $$

Denote $A_k =\binom{X}{k} / \binom{Y}{k}$ and $S = \sum_{k=1}^X A_k$. We note that 
$$
\begin{aligned}
A_k& = \frac{\binom{X}{k}}{\binom{Y}{k}}\\
&= \frac{\binom{X+1}{k+1} - \binom{X}{k+1}}{\binom{Y}{k}} \\
&= \frac{\frac{X+1}{k+1}\binom{X}{k}}{\binom{Y}{k}} - \frac{\binom{X}{k+1}}{\binom{Y}{k}} \\ 
&=  \frac{\frac{X+1}{k+1}\binom{X}{k}}{\binom{Y}{k}} - \frac{\binom{X}{k+1}}{\frac{k+1}{Y-k}\binom{Y}{k+1}} \\
&= \frac{X+1}{k+1} A_k - \frac{Y-k}{k+1}A_{k+1}.
\end{aligned}\\
$$
We rearrange to conclude 
$$
\begin{aligned}
(Y+1)A_{k+1}-XA_k &= (k+1)A_{k+1} - kA_k\\
\sum_{k=1}^{X-1} \big((Y+1)A_{k+1}-XA_k \big) &= \sum_{k=1}^{X-1}\big((k+1)A_{k+1} - kA_k\big)\\
(Y+1) (S-A_1) - X(S-A_X)&=XA_X - A_1\\
(Y-X+1)S &= YA_1\\
S &= \frac{Y}{Y-X+1}A_1\\
&=\frac{Y}{Y-X+1} \cdot \frac{X}{Y} \\ 
&= \frac{X}{Y-X+1},
\end{aligned}
$$
as desired. $\qquad \blacksquare$

I am at floor $n=34$, therefore on average I just have 
$$
\frac{1}{34-21} = \frac{1}{13} \approx 7.69\%
$$
chance of being the first one to leave if there are at least 2 buttons pressed in control panel.
