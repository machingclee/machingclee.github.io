intro: "Sometimes a library may require user installing gcc, c++, ca-certificates, or some other linux-specific libraries. Let's use docker image to provide us a consistent working environment."

#### Why 

- By looking at the `Dockerfile` clearly we wouldn't want to install them at the developer's machine because some may use windows, some may use mac. 

- By using dev container, we can unify the dev environment.

#### Project Structure

#### devcontainer.json

```json
{
    "name": "For Kafka",
    "build": {
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
    }
}
```

#### Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine

RUN apk --no-cache add \
      bash \
      g++ \
      ca-certificates \
      lz4-dev \
      musl-dev \
      cyrus-sasl-dev \
      openssl-dev \
      make \
      python3

RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps gcc zlib-dev libc-dev bsd-compat-headers py-setuptools bash
```
- Note that we don't write `RUN npm install <package-name>` inside the `Dockerfile` because by default we are at the root level inside the container where we are not allowed to `WRITE` at that level. 

- Even we `mkdir -p` and `WORKDIR` at a directory and successfully  `npm install`, but inside container we are at the workspace defined by the vscode extention `Remote Development` rather than the directory specified by `WORKDIR`.

- The correct procedure should be simply install all the native linux libraries, and we install runtime-specific library ***inside*** the container.

- Note that the `node_modules` installed inside the container will be linux-specific, running it in windows will fail.
