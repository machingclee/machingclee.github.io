intro:  Given $(X,Y,Z)$ and its (joint) distribution on $\mathbb R^3$, we try to find the distribution of $W=X+Y+Z$ on $\mathbb R$.
toc: no

As a review of statistics I try to work on this problem:

> **Problem.**  Let $(X,Y,Z)$ be a 3-dimensional random variable which follows the distribution  (i.e., the probability density function is)
> $$
>  f(x,y,z) = \begin{cases} 
> \displaystyle\frac{24}{(1+x+y+z)^5}, & x>0,y>0,z>0,\\
> 0, &\text{otherwise.}
> \end{cases}
> $$
> Find the probability density function of $W:=X+Y+Z$.

 I start off by guessing the answer to be $24/(1+w)^5$ very sloppily, which is of course wrong and I tried to figure out how I can relate $W$ with $f(x,y,z)$.

Let us start from the definition, what does $f$ tell us? In view of a distribution it tells us how are $(X,Y,Z)$'s spreaded in $\mathbb R^3$. In other words, for every given $A\subseteq \mathbb R^3$, we have 
$$
\mathbb P\big((X,Y,Z)\in A\big) = \int_A f(x)\,dV(x)
$$
which is the proportion of $(X,Y,Z)$'s lying within $A$ and $dV$ denotes the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R^3$. From that recall also that to find the probability density function $p_W$ of $W$, it is sufficient to find its cummulative distribution $\int_0^t p_W(x)\,dx$ (since then we can differentiate pointwise).

From this, consider the relation $W\leq t$, which is 
$$
\begin{aligned}
W\leq t 
&\iff X+Y+Z\leq t,X,Y,Z>0\\
&\iff 0< Z\leq t-X-Y, 0< t-X-Y, X,Y>0\\
&\iff 0< Z\leq T-X-Y, 0<Y < t-X, 0<t-X, X>0\\
&\iff 0< Z\leq T-X-Y, 0<Y < t-X, 0< X<t, 
\end{aligned}
$$
we conclude that $w=x+y+z\leq t$ ($x,y,z>0$) if and only if $(x,y,z)$ lies in the set
$$
A_t := \{(x,y,z): x\in (0,t), y\in (0, t-x), z\in (t-x-y)\},
$$
therefore 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^tp_W(x)\,dx 
&=\mathbb P(W\leq t)\\
&=\mathbb P\big((X,Y,Z)\in  A_t\big)\\
&=\int_{A_t}f(u)\,dV(u)\\
&=\int_0^t \int_0^{t-x}\int_0^{t-x-y} f(x,y,z) \,dzdydx.
\end{aligned}
$$
The answer is 
$$
p_W(t)=\frac{d}{dt}\left(\int_0^t\int_0^{t-x}\int_0^{t-x-y} \frac{24}{(1+x+y+z)^5}\,dzdydx\right).
$$

$\qed$
