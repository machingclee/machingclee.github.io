title: Debug Javascript For Individual File

intro: Sometimes it is convenient to directly execute a test file to understand how the project work. In the past we discussed how to make a runnable test file in python, in javascript we can use exactly the same approach for debugging.

#### Lunch.json

The following configuration can enable us to run whatever file in debug mode.

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug File",
      "program": "${file}",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "some-stage",
        "BDSONS_DB_PWD": "some-password"
      },
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  ]
}
```

It is worth noting that some test cases also require specific environment variable. But how do we actually run a test file using library like ava (which is very similar to `pytest`)?

For that we need an analog of `if __name__ == "__main__":` in python, which turns out to be

```js
if (require.main === module) {
  // our test function
}
```

By using these we can design a test file that can be both executed by test library and also by developer individually.
