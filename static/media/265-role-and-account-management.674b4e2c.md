#### Create User and Drop User

```sql
CREATE USER testuser WITH PASSWORD 'testpassword123321';
```
```sql
DROP USER IF EXISTS testuser;
```

#### User = Role + Login Persmission
From [AWS Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/managing-postgresql-users-and-roles):

- **Users**, **groups**, and **roles** ***are the same thing*** in PostgreSQL, with the only difference being that users have permission to log in by default. The `CREATE USER` and `CREATE GROUP` statements are actually aliases for the `CREATE ROLE` statement.

- Therefore managing users is enough and we will ignore `roles` in users management. 

- Also from PostgreSQL documentation command that applies to a role can also be applied to a user as well.

#### Grant Permissions to a User

In the sequel let's assume we are working on:
- a database called `billie`
- a user called `testuser`

##### Connection
A permission to connect to a database:
```sql
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE billie TO testuser;
```
##### Enable or Disable to Grant Usage on Schema (Optional)
- If a user is **not** a **database maintainer**, that user should not have this right and this part **can be skipped**.
- Although a usage is granted, there is no right yet.
```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO testuser;
```
```sql
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM testuser;
```

##### Grant or Revoke Usage (Create, Delete, Alter Table) on Schema
###### Create Table

```sql
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO testuser;
```
or the ***opposite*** 
```sql
REVOKE USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM testuser;
```

###### Alter Table (No such thing)

From [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html):
- ***Only the owner*** of a table can alter the table.
- Each table can only have one owner (not including `superuser`).
- In worst case, `superuser` can change the table ownership by 
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE table_name OWNER TO new_owner_name;
  ```
  and let another developer  take care of that table.

###### Delete Table (No such thing)

- ***Only the owner*** of a table can drop the table. 

- Therefore in theory only two users can drop a table.




##### Grant SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE Rights

###### For Existing Tables only

Note that the following command only applies to existing tables. The user has ***no privilege*** to new tables ***created after the execution***.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO testuser;
```
We need to run the next command (in the next code block) `ALTER DEFAULT ...` in order to apply the changes to new tables as well.

###### Extends to Tables in the Future

```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO testuser;
```
Note that we will be needing to run the opposite
```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES FROM testuser;
```
in order to delete this role. 


#### Create a User with Limited Rights for Backend's CRUD Service
##### Creation

```sql-1{4,6,8-11}
CREATE USER testuser WITH PASSWORD 'aaaabbb';

GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE billie TO testuser;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO testuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO testuser;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO testuser;

ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public 
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO testuser;
--or
  REVOKE SELECT ON TABLES FROM testuser
```

- Line 4 ***is necessary***, without that `testuser` can view the tables but ***cannot*** even `select` within the table.
- Line 6 ***is necessary***, otherwise `testuser` cannot insert record with auto-incremented counter as `id`, unless the only type of `id` we use is `UUID`.

- Lines 8-11 are needed only when you want to adjust the right of `testuser`.

If you need to grant `CREATE` right of a schema to a person (e.g., table creation, usually a trusted person who performs well), add:
```sql
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO testuser;
```




##### Deletion 
```sql-1
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public REVOKE 
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES FROM testuser;

REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM testuser
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE billie FROM testuser;
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM testuser;
DROP USER IF EXISTS testuser;
```

- Lines 4-7 should be executed one by one. Running in batch may fail.

#### Useful SQL for Querying Users and Their Priviledges
##### View a list of Database Users

```sql
SELECT usename AS role_name,
  CASE 
     WHEN usesuper AND usecreatedb THEN 
	   CAST('superuser, create database' AS pg_catalog.text)
     WHEN usesuper THEN 
	    CAST('superuser' AS pg_catalog.text)
     WHEN usecreatedb THEN 
	    CAST('create database' AS pg_catalog.text)
     ELSE 
	    CAST('' AS pg_catalog.text)
  END role_attributes
FROM pg_catalog.pg_user
ORDER BY role_name desc;
```

##### View Priviledges Owned by a User

```sql
SELECT 
    grantee,
    table_schema AS schema,
    table_name,
    privilege_type AS privilege,
    grantor
FROM information_schema.table_privileges
WHERE grantee = 'testuser';
```

Now we can `REVOKE` the right one by one.
