#### Description of an Unusual Excel File

Assume that we are going to process the following "unstructured" (or structured in an unusual way) excel file:

<a href="/assets/tech/031.png">
  <img src="/assets/tech/031.png" width="100%">
</a>
<p/>

The image displays an excel organized:

- with some row being categories,
- with some row being items of categories right above, and regarded as the true header of the table,
- with some row meaning True and False (colored or not).
- with some column even being empty.

It cannot be regarded as a usual table, we have to carefully handle it case by case. That means we have to be very familiar with package that handle the excel files.

#### Pandas

##### Read Lines for Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

excel_file = "Program_Details.xlsx"
df = pd.read_excel(excel_file, engine="openpyxl", sheet_name="Raw Data")

symp_row = df.iloc[2, 6:]
print(symp_row)
```

```text
Unnamed: 6                              Anxiety
Unnamed: 7                          Bereavement

                             ...
Unnamed: 220                                US$
Unnamed: 221                   HK$\n(US$1=HK$8)
Unnamed: 222    Discount /\nShipping /\nSurplus
Unnamed: 223                     price per drop
Unnamed: 224                                NaN
```

- Regardless of the behaviour of how pandas handle empty rows, we can experiment on
  ```python
  df.iloc[i, 6:]
  ```
  to test which row index `i` we should start with.
- Empty cells have value `nan` when we cast to `string`.
- To iterate over the row, we use
  ```python
  # generator that gives (col_name, value):
  df.iloc[i, 6:].items()
  ```
- we can also use

  ```python
  datas_df = df.iloc[0:, 1:4]

  for index, value in datas_df.iterrows():
    col1, col2, col3 = value
  ```

  to unpack the values.

#### openpyxl

However, there is no way for pandas to get the color of a cell, we resort to `openpyxl` which `pandas` base on in order to read `.xlsx` (another extension for excel file).

##### Read Lines for openpyxl

```python
import openpyxl
from openpyxl import load_workbook

excel_file = "Program_Details.xlsx"
wb = load_workbook(excel_file, data_only=True)
sheet = wb['Raw Data']
```

- The cell of the `i`-th row and `j`-th column is `sheet[i][j]`, the values is read by
  ```python
  cell = sheet[i][j]
  cell.value
  ```
- The background color of the cell can be obtained by
  ```python
  cell.fill.start_color.index
  ```

#### Conclusion

- If we just want to read an excel file, then `openpyxl` is enough.

- If we want to manipulate the data in an excel file, then we use `pandas` as the syntax
  ```python
  df.iloc[i:j, h:k]
  ```
  is very handy compared to `openpyxl`.
