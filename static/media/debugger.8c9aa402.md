title: Python Debugger with Project Directory Included in sys.path

intro: Record a structure that makes a `test_sth.py` debuggable and make sure project directory path is included in `sys.path` when debug mode is enabled.

#### Debuggable Test File

We have discussed how to include project directory in `sys.path` when running `pytest`. Sometimes it is much more convenient to debug a utility function rather than testing it.

In order to make statements like `from src.utils.abc import Abc` ***always*** possible, our `sys.path` has to include the directory path that contains the folder `src`.

Suppose I want to record a concrete usage of a utility class in a test  `test/unit/test_abc.py`, where:

```python
# test/unit/test_abc.py
from src.utils.abc import Abc

def test_abc(): 
  abc = Abc()
  abc.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
  test_abc()
```

Now `test_abc.py` is not only a testable file, it is also debuggable because we can trigger `debug` action in vscode as if we are running the script directly (so that `__name__ == "__main__"`). 

An appropriate configuration for debugger has to be made in order to make `src` folder accessible.

#### Debugger Configuration: .vscode/launch.json

```json
// .vscode/launch.json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
           "name": "Python: Current File",
           "type": "python",
           "request": "launch",
           "program": "${file}",
           "console": "integratedTerminal",
           "env": { "PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceRoot}"}
        }
    ]
}
```
Now happy debugging (just press F5).
