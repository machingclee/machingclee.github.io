intro: Mask in numpy, tensorflow and pytorch is very useful to filter out desired values, but sometimes the index that the mask marks as `True` is also import, we record a function to retrive those information.

#### Masks 
Suppose that 
- `target_masks` is of shape `(N, width, height, 10, 2)`,
- where `N` denotes the number of batches, 
- `width`, `height` denote the size of a feature, 
- and for every given `n, j, i, k`, `target_masks[n, j, i, k]` is a one-hot vector.
Then we can create a mask by 
```python
positive_sample = target_masks[..., 1] == 1
```
This will create a mask of shape `(N, width, height, 10)` in which all values are boolean, but how do we know all the indexes `n, j, i, k` that the mask indicates as `True`? 

Sometimes the mask itself is enough to filter out other related `np.array`'s (by applying the mask like `other_nparray[positive_sample]`), but sometimes the spartial index `j, i` also provides us the information we need.

For that we will use the following function:

#### get_indexes_from_mask(mask)

This function is as simple as:

```python
def get_indexes_from_mask(mask):
    return np.array(list(zip(*np.where(mask))))
```

For example, suppose that each position `j, i` was assigned a `box` in `boxes` with shape `(N, height, width, 4)`  and a `score` in `scores` with shape `(N, height, width, 1)`, then we can create a mask by 
```python
score_mask = scores[..., 0] > 0.8
```
Now apart from getting the desired scores by 
- `selected_scores=scores[score_mask]` (this will be ***flattened*** and of shape `(n', 1)`), 
we can equivalently:
- ```python 
  selected_indexes = get_indexes_from_mask(score_mask)
  selected_scores = np.array([scores[tuple(index)] 
                              for index in selected_indexes])
  ```
  Note that 
  - numpy array does not accept `int-np-array` as an index (unlike `bool-np-array`),
  - We need to convert `int-np-array` into `int-tuple`. The conversion is simply by `tuple(np-array)`.

#### tf.where, tf.gather (to be updated)
Equivalently we can use `tf.where` and `tf.gather`.
