#### Capture Variables from Event Text

In ACT every **_event text_** will be processed by our **_triggers_** (we can fire event text from our action as well, see conditional action in the next section).

The trigger determines if the subsequent **_actions_** take place by the following regular expression:

[![](/assets/img/2025-01-11-09-16-03.png)](/assets/img/2025-01-11-09-16-03.png)

Let's analyse the grouping here:

```text
(?<=\[notice\]\s)(?<sentence>.*)，位置(?<position>((\d|\w){1}))(?=|)
```

They all follow the pattern:

```text
(?<variable-name><matching-pattern>)
```

which means that

1. Once `matching-pattern` matched
2. Assign the matched string to `variable-name`.

Note that we always just want the partially matched string. The `match-group` is exactly what we want.

#### Actions to the Event Text: Scalar Variable Operation and Trigger Operation

##### Set-variable Action: Set the captured variable into global state

Assume a regular expression is met, let's add an action:

[![](/assets/img/2025-01-11-09-26-01.png)](/assets/img/2025-01-11-09-26-01.png)

Here the variable `sentence` is captured from `(?<sentence>.*)` in the example of previous section. Under the hood it:

1. Created a new variable called `sigma_content` in **_global scope_**.
2. Assigned a scoped variable (on captured) `sentence` into `sigma_content`. The value is dereferrenced by `${sigma_content}`.

3. This is equivalent to
   ```js
   global_state["sigma_content"] = sentence;
   ```
   To access this global state, we will use `${var:sigma_content}` later.

##### Conditional Action: Fire another trigger conditionally using global state

Let's add an action and select Trigger Operation:

![](/assets/img/2025-01-11-09-53-19.png)

This time we choose to fire another trigger with the information captured from scoped varaiable `position`.

![](/assets/img/2025-01-11-09-35-27.png)

You will be adding another trigger to be fired by the action we discuss just now.

Now let's switch to **_Action condition_**, you are free to add any condition using the global states as follows:

![](/assets/img/2025-01-11-09-50-25.png)

#### Reset Variables

We need to reset variables when next fight starts:
