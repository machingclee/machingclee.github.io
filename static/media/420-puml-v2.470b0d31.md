#### `.puml`

##### Import Custom Component Definitions

As the definition becomes very long, interested reader can refer to:


- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/machingclee/2025-08-23-plantUML-config/refs/heads/main/lib_eventstorming-v7.puml


This custom definition defines the following components:

- `Command`
- `Aggregate`
- `Policy`
- `Handler`
- `Event`


##### Simplify the code of path of arrows

In the past if we have 
```puml
actor Teacher as Teacher
Command("ACommand")
Aggregate("BAggregate)
Event("CEvent")
Policy("DPolicy")
```
We need to write separately:
```puml 
Teacher --> ACommand
ACommand --> BAggregate
BAggregate --> CEvent
CEvent --> DPolicy
```
Now we can condense them into 

```puml
$flow5(Teacher, ACommand, BAggregate, CEvent, DPolicy)
```

It is now more clean, succinct and maintainahle.

We have provided serveral definitions here:

- `$flow(...up to 3 args)`
- `$flow3(3 args, diverge from 4 onwards)`
- `$flow4(4 args, diverge from 5 onwards)`
- `$flow5(5 args, diverge from 6 onwards)`
- `$flow6(6 args, diverge from 6 onwards)`

The function `$flow{n}` will connect the  first $n$ elements, and $(n+1)$-th, $(n+2)$-th, $(n+3)$-th elements will diverge from the $n$-th element. 

This is used when some command may in turn produce multiple events from an aggregate.


##### Shell Script to Compile `.puml` into `.pdf`

```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data machingclee/plantuml-pdf -tpdf timetable.puml
```


##### Coding example, the `timetable.puml`


We import our custom definition in line 6 below:


```puml{6}
@startuml
