intro: Basic command needed to mount a google drive and also to unzip compressed large dataset.

#### Google Drive Mounting

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

Now we can work on colab as in we are working in local environment.

#### Unzip Files

Now you can `cd` into your working directory. For me:

```python
! cd '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/cycleGAN-tensorflow'
```

Inside `cycleGAN-tensorflow` I have a compressed file called `horse2zebra.zip`. We can now unzip it by

```python
!unzip horse2zebra.zip
```

which will create a new folder called `horse2zebra` and decompress your files into it.
