#### Introduction of Function Literals


- Function literals are frequently used ***as a constructor*** of objects.

- Well known examples are `build.gradle.kts` and `jetpack-compose` for Andriod or Desktop UIs.

In the sequel let's consider the following builder function, a ***function literal*** takes the form 

```kotlin
fun builder(dummyName: ClassA.() -> Unit) {
    ...
}
```
which means that:

1. We define a lambda function that can be treated as a method of `ClassA`
2. This lambda function takes the signature `() -> Unit`.
3. To call this lambda function, we invoke `classA.dummyName()`.
4. `builder` orchestrates the execution of the above defined operations.

#### Example

```kotlin
class Properties {
    var time: String? = null
}

class BuildInfo {
    private var properties: Properties? = null

    fun withProperties(configure: Properties.() -> Unit) {
        val _properties = Properties()
        _properties.configure()
        properties = _properties
    }
}

class SpringBootExtension {
    private buildInfo: BuildInfo? = null

    fun withBuildInfo(configure: BuildInfo.() -> Unit) {
        val _buildInfo = BuildInfo()
        _buildInfo.configure()
        this.buildInfo = _buildInfo
    }
}
```

Let's create a builder function which builds a `SpringBootExtension` object.
```kotlin 
// builder function
fun springBootEextension(build: SpringBootExtension.() -> Unit) {
    val extension = SpringBootExtension()
    extension.build()
    return extension
}
```
Which means that 
1. `springBootEextension` accepts a lambda function which is defined ***as if we are inside of***  the class definition of `SpringBootExtension`, 
2. The name `build` is in fact dummy and can be anything we want, it is just a name to invoke the execution of the lambda.
```kotlin
fun createExtension() {
    val extension = springBootEextension { // trailing closure without input params
        withBuildInfo { // it is a method inside of SpringBootEextension
                        // it is accessible by the closure because our context is now SpringBootEextension
            withProperties { // accepts another closure for configuration
                time = null  // context is now Property class, can make changes to the created Property object
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- In short, `ClassA.() -> Unit` can be read as configuration of `ClassA` in many cases (and bear in mind that it is a lambda function defined inside of `ClassA`). 

- In terms of this terminology: 
  - `springBootEextension(_: SpringBootExtension.() -> Unit)` accepts a configuration of `SpringBootExtension`
  - `withBuildInfo(_: BuildInfo.() -> Unit)` accepts a configuration of `BuildInfo`
  - `withProperties(_: Properties.() -> Unit)` accepts a configuration of `Properties`
