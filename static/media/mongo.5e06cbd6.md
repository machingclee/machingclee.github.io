title: Set up Local Environment for Mongo using Docker

intro: Since I have docker already installed, just record a few steps to get the local development ready using mongo db with authentication.
---

#### Start from Docker Hub

We don't need to install anything from mongo website, we just need to pull the mongo image from docker hub.

To have authentication, a super/root user called `admin` must be created in the first place. For that, instead of just running the image, we pass the environment variables

- `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` and
- `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME`
  in

```text
docker run
  -d
  --name bddms-mongo \
  -p 27017:27017 \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=123 \
  -v "/c/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/db_backup/docker_bddms":/data/db mongo
```

Here my local directory `/c/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/db_backup/docker_bddms` is mount as a volume to the container's directory `/data/db`.

#### Create User in Mongo Shell

When this image is run in the detached mode, run

```text
docker exec -it cb39731a97ff sh
```

to get into the cli of the container running our mongo instance with id `cb39731a97ff`.

We are ready to init the mongo shell and add user. For this, run

```text
mongo -u admin -p 123
```

For sheer purpose of fulfilling the hard-coded config in the project, I need:

- A user called `bdsons` with pwd `bdsonspass`;
- `authSource=admin` for authentication, i.e., create a user `bdsons` **_inside_** the database `admin`;
- `bdsons` to have access right to the database `bdsons`.

Therefore:

```text
use admin

db.createUser({ \
user: "bdsons", pwd: "bdsonspass", \
roles:[{db: "admin", role:"readWrite"}, {db:"bdsons", role:"readWrite"}] \
})
```

Then by running `db.getUsers()` we have

```text
[
  ...,
  {
    "_id" : "admin.bdsons",
    "userId" : UUID("815c8f70-a65f-452d-a877-864d2d69fa00"),
    "user" : "bdsons",
    "db" : "admin",
    "roles" : [
      {
        "role" : "readWrite",
        "db" : "bdsons"
      },
      {
        "role" : "readWrite",
        "db" : "admin"
      }
    ],
    "mechanisms" : [
      "SCRAM-SHA-1",
      "SCRAM-SHA-256"
    ]
  }
]
```

`authSource` in the connection string to mongodb will look at `user.db` for authentication (trap: not the `"db"` in the `roles`).

#### Connect to the mongoDb with Auth

Now I can connect to the database named `bdsons` by using the string:

```text
mongodb://bdsons:bdsonspass@localhost:27017/bdsons?authSource=admin
```
