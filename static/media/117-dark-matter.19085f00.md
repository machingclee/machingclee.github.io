#### Repository

- In Python with Tkinter: \
  https://github.com/machingclee/TextCaptrue_FirstTrial

...
```

Now we can separat attributes and content as follows:

```js
import matter from "gray-matter";

...

const { content, data } = matter(mdText);
```

`content` will always be a string. Don't forget to cast your data to your custom type for clean coding:

```js
const data_ = data as CustomType;
```

#### Remark on Implicit Conversion

Specific keywords will trigger implicit conversion from plain text to available data type.

- `111`, a plain number, will be converted to a number
- `false`, and `true` will be converted to booleans
- `2022-01-01` will be converted to a Date object

To avoid them, we can enclose desired string by `"`'s. For example, `update: "true"` in the attribute list will produce `data.update: string`.
