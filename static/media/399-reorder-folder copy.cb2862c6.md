<style>
  video {
    border-radius: 4px;
  }
  img {
    max-width: 660px;
  }
</style>

In `.vscode/settings.json` we add:

```json
    "files.exclude": {
        "explorer.fileNesting.enabled": true,
        "explorer.fileNesting.patterns": {
            "!*": "${capture}/*"
        }
    }
```

Then any directory prefixed by `!` will be shown at the top.

For example in frontend we frequently create `query` and `mutation` files, it is extremely tedious to locate the `react-query` folder and create corresponding files inside of it.

Now `!react-query` is always on the top:
