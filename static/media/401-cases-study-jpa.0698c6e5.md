#### Case Encountered

In my timetable system I need to ***add*** an "extended" class when  a status is changed from `STATUS_A` to `STATUS_B`.

On the contrary, that "extended" class needs to be ***removed*** when we switch from `STATUS_B` back to `STATUS_A`


The forward path is smooth (adding an extended class), but removing an entity by 
```kotlin
someRespositove.delete(someEntity)
```
***can fail*** in some cases when JPA ***don't know*** the correct deletion order of entities in a set of relation tables (i.e., when there are many `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, etc, involved).




#### The Problem
##### Tables Involved: The ordinary class and the extended class

[![](/assets/img/2025-06-29-23-48-33.png)](/assets/img/2025-06-29-23-48-33.png)

- A package has many classes, governed by `rel_class_studentpackage`

- A special type of class is called ***Extended Class***.  Which is also treated as a class, with the additional attributes listed in `extended_class` table (and associated by `extended_class."classId"`).
- In the future if we have another special class, like "Trial Class", we will create another `trial_class` table and let it refers to  `class` table. We achieve polymorphism by ***equipping*** `class` table with additional table.

##### What confuses JPA when deleting a class that is an extended class?

The problem arises when we try to execute the following code written in kotlin:


```kotlin{11}
@TransactionalEventListener(phase = TransactionPhase.BEFORE_COMMIT)
fun manageMakeupClassesOn(event: TimetableEvents.ClassInfoUpdated) {
    val targetClassId = event.reqBody.classId
    val targetClass = classRepository.findByIdOrNull(targetClassId) ?: throw TimetableException("Class not found")
    val pkg = targetClass.studentPackage ?: throw TimetableException("Student package not found")

    if (/* when targetClass switch from STATUS_B to STATUS A */) {
        // this is also a `Class` entity:
        val extendedClass = targetClass.extensionToRecord?.toClass 
        if (extendedClass != null) {
            classRepository.delete(extendedClass)
        }
        ...
    }
```

**Problem.** After the transaction is completed, our `Class` entity `extendedClass` entity ***has not been removed***.


##### What is the blocker for the failed deletion of an entity?

Deletion of an "Extended Class" (namely, a class that has a reference from  `entended_class` table)  entity involves the following:

Let's use `A` $\to$ `B` to mean `A` refers to `B` (i.e., `A` has a column referencing to the id column of `B`).

We have the following:

- `extended_class` $\to$ `Class`
- `rel_class_studentpackage`  $\to$ `Class`

Upon deleting the `Class` object, JPA doesn't know which one of `{ extended_class, rel_class_studentpackage }` should be deleted first, which ends up ***deleting nothing*** and completes the transaction silently.


##### A fix in JPA: First Delete `rel_class_studentpackage` → `Class`

```kotlin-{11}
@TransactionalEventListener(phase = TransactionPhase.BEFORE_COMMIT)
fun manageMakeupClassesOn(event: TimetableEvents.ClassInfoUpdated) {
    val targetClassId = event.reqBody.classId
    val targetClass = classRepository.findByIdOrNull(targetClassId) ?: throw TimetableException("Class not found")
    val pkg = targetClass.studentPackage ?: throw TimetableException("Student package not found")

    if (/* when targetClass switch from STATUS_B to STATUS A */) {
        // this is also a `Class` entity:
        val extendedClass = targetClass.extensionToRecord?.toClass 
        if (extendedClass != null) {
            pkg.classes.remove(extendedClass)
            classRepository.delete(extendedClass)
        }
        ...
    }
```

Now we explicitly tell JPA:
> Hey, let's delete the entity from `rel_class_studentpackage` first, then deleting the remaining

##### Can deleting `extended_class` → `Class` help?

Unfortunately ***NO***, deleting all the relations between `extended_class` and `Class` does not solve the problem from experiement. In JPA a `@OneToMany` relation is usually the ***major*** blocker that makes the deletion failed.


#### General Solution to Delete an Entity Safely

1. We break the `@OneToMany` relation  by `A.entities.remove(entity)`

2. Then we delete the entity by `repository.delete(entity)`
