#### Algorithms
##### The Merge Sort

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
  if len(arr) == 1:
    return arr

  mid_index = int(len(arr)/2)
  
  L = arr[0:mid_index]
  R = arr[mid_index:]

  L = merge_sort(L)
  R = merge_sort(R)
```
* The algorithm is locked and looped here until a return is resolved.
* When `merge_sort(len-1 array)`'s return two sorted arrays to the previous call, `L` and `R` then merge into a len-2 array `arr`, and get returned.
* Then the locked `merge_sort(len-2 array)`s' call continue, `L` and `R` then merge into a sorted len-4 array `arr`.
* Similarly, the locked `merge_sort(len-4 array)`s' call return two sorted arrays separately, they then merge into a len-8 sorted array.

```python
  head_L, head_R, i = 0, 0, 0
  
  while head_L < len(L) and head_R < len(R):
    if L[head_L] < R[head_R]:
      arr[i] = L[head_L]
      head_L += 1
    else:
      arr[i] = R[head_R]
      head_R += 1
    i += 1
  
  while head_L < len(L):
    arr[i] = L[head_L]
    head_L += 1
    i += 1

  while head_R < len(R):
    arr[i] = R[head_R]
    head_R += 1
    i += 1
    
  print(f"sorting L:{L} and R:{R}, result:{arr}")  
  return arr
```
We try to sort the following and print log:
```python
to_be_sorted = [2,10,5,100,66,24,27,30]
merge_sort(to_be_sorted)
```
which yields 
```text
sorting L:[2] and R:[10], result:[2, 10]
sorting L:[5] and R:[100], result:[5, 100]
sorting L:[2, 10] and R:[5, 100], result:[2, 5, 10, 100]
sorting L:[66] and R:[24], result:[24, 66]
sorting L:[27] and R:[30], result:[27, 30]
sorting L:[24, 66] and R:[27, 30], result:[24, 27, 30, 66]
sorting L:[2, 5, 10, 100] and R:[24, 27, 30, 66], result:[2, 5, 10, 24, 27, 30, 66, 100]
```

##### The Time Complexity

The algorithm in plain text:

* We are bisecting our length-$n$ long array by half until the resulting array has length $1$, which takes $\log_2 n$ steps to complete. For each dividing steps, it takes exactly $n$ operations for cloning elements to the evenly divided pairs of arrays (`L` and `R`)'s. At the end of bisections, we get at most $O(n\log n)$ operations.

* Starting from length-1 array, we merge pairs of adjacent arrays in the 3 while loops above, these triples of while loops in total take at most $O(n)$ operations. But it just takes $\log n$ stages of steps to merge from length-1 array to length-$n$ array.

Therefore by summing up, the time complexity of merge sort is $O(n\log n)$.
