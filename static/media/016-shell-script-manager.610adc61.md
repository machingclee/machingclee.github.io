##### Tech Stack

<rustssmtechstack></rustssmtechstack>


##### Why this Project?


- When there are many projects opened at the same time, finding and switching between them is a nightmare. 
- Especially when I need to switch to ***different*** IDEs and sourcetree folders for pulling or creating merge requests.

- Plus I want a project to ***get me more used*** to Rust programming.



#### Decision between `Egui`, `Tauri` and `Iced`


##### `Iced` 

The official website of iced is linked [***here***](https://iced.rs/).

My first attemp to GUI application in rust starts with `Iced`:

- [2025-10-13-Iced-gui-experiment](https://github.com/machingclee/2025-10-13-Iced-gui-experiment)

To me `Iced` has the following ***disadvantages***:

1. `Iced` is ***nice*** for the philosophy of mutating any application state by messages. But it is also ***bad*** in the sense that every tiny little UI state change must be processed by a message.


2. It is a relatively ***young*** framework.  Its first stable version was released in 2022.

3. The ***variety*** of UI-components in `Iced` is relatively ***limited*** compared to other frameworks, a simple and standard component such as "context-menu" is even not a built-in component in the framework.



##### `Tauri`


As of the time I build this application I was trying `egui` and didn't study `Tauri` yet, I will definitely give it a try.






##### Why `egui` stands out for Rust Beginner

From the point of view of learning a language, I personally prefer `egui` for the following reasons when I make the study:

- [Rich UI components and Rich Documentation (click me)](https://www.egui.rs/)

  [![](/assets/img/2025-10-26-14-19-40.png)](/assets/img/2025-10-26-14-19-40.png)



- Easy to learn, we copy the code from [official website](https://www.egui.rs/) ***for whatever component*** we want and start implementing our own logic.

- ***Same language*** in frontend and backend, enjoyable experience for the communication between frontend and backend.


- Rust has built-in channel-and-message mechanism, making the ***Domain Driven Design***  easy to implement. Therefore we have clear separation of concerns by defining:

  - **Commands.** Only command can trigger backend/system state change.
  - **Event.** Only event can trigger UI state change
  - And each completion of a command will dispatch one or more events.





#### Future Plan: Rewrite in `Tauri`

- This project has already satisfied my learning purpose of getting familiar with Rust programming language.


- I will rewrite this project in `Tauri` as I am not going to write graphics-intensive applications  (game tools, 3D viewers, data visualization), which are what `egui` good at. 

- With my react skill I can get a more ***polished*** UI with $\frac{1}{10}$ the effort, and I can focus on features instead of fighting with UI implementation (in `egui` making an `egui::Frame` to have a "hover-and-highlight" effect is horribly difficult).
