We study the following locks:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

var wg sync.WaitGroup
var mutex sync.RWMutex

func write() {
	defer wg.Done()

	mutex.Lock()
	fmt.Println("Writing ...")
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
	mutex.Unlock()
}

func read() {
	defer wg.Done()
	mutex.RLock()
	fmt.Println("Reading ...")
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
	mutex.RUnlock()
}

func main() {
	for r := 0; r < 10; r++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go write()
	}
	for r := 0; r < 10; r++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go read()
	}
	wg.Wait()
}
```

- In `RWMutex`, when we are writing we use `Lock()` to block any ***read*** and ***write*** access until we `Unlock()` it. 
- However, when we use `RLock()`, we are telling compiler we **allow** concurrent reads.
- If we execute the code above, we have:
  ```text
  Writing ...
  ```
  and ***1s*** later:
  ```text
  Reading ...
  Reading ...
  Reading ...
  Reading ...
  Reading ...
  Reading ...
  Reading ...
  Reading ...
  Reading ...
  Reading ...
  ```
  and then the following 1s later one another:
  ```text
  Writing ... // 1s
  Writing ... // 1s
  Writing ... // 1s
  Writing ...
  Writing ...     .
  Writing ...     .
  Writing ...     .
  Writing ...
  Writing ... // 1s
  ```
