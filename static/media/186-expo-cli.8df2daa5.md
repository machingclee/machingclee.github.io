#### Commonly Used Commands

- `yarn add eas-cli`
- `yarn eas device:create`
- ```json
  "scripts": {
      "start:dev": "env-cmd -f .env-cmdrc -e default,dev expo start --dev-client",
      "android": "expo run:android",
      "ios": "expo run:ios",
      "prebuild": "npx expo prebuild",
      "doctor": "npx expo-doctor",
      "easios": "eas build --profile development --platform ios",
      "easan": "eas build --profile development --platform android"
  },
  ```
- repeated use of `expo doctor` can resolve many building issues at the early stage.

#### Development Build

- After `yarn easios` or `yarn easan`, a development build will be compiled on cloud.

  [![](/assets/tech/186/001.png)](/assets/tech/186/001.png)

- This **development build** must be linked with `expo dev-client` via our `yarn start:dev` command above.
- Our flag `--profile development` in `eas build` will use the config in `eas.json`
  ```json
  {
    "cli": {
      "version": ">= 5.2.0"
    },
    "build": {
      "development": {
        "distribution": "internal",
        "android": {
          "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleDebug"
        },
        "ios": {
          "buildConfiguration": "Debug"
        }
      },
      "preview": {
        "distribution": "internal"
      },
      "production": {}
    },
    "submit": {
      "production": {}
    }
  }
  ```
  Under this flag, the **_environment variable_** in **_development build_** is not determined at compile time, we can change the environment variables when we spawn a dev-client.
- If you wish, you can embed fixed environment variable in `eas build` by providing the variables in `eas.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "build": {
      "production": {
        "env": {
          "EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL": "https://api.production.com"
        }
      },
      "test": {
        "env": {
          "EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL": "https://api.test.com"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- After `eas build` is finished, there will be a QR code for android and ios to download the `development build` that contains all the native code we need.

- We will keep developing the project in `expo dev-client`, but this time, we will link to our `development build` with a new QR code:

  [![](/assets/tech/186/002.png)](/assets/tech/186/002.png)

  instead of `expo-go`. Just scan it, we get the same developer experience as before even on Windows machine.

#### Prebuild

- A **_prebuild_** is actually the stuff that is generated in `eas build` on cloud if we have never `prebuild` the project.

- For example, if we look at [react-native-twilio-video-webrtc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-twilio-video-webrtc), since this package has native code in both android and ios, **in the past** we need to
  - Start from `react-cli` / `eject` from `expo`.
  - Inject native code, and keep going without `expo`.
- This workflow is nowadays called a **_bare workflow_**.

- Now look at **Usage with Expo** section of the npm page, the process becomes simply adding

  ```json
  {
    "name": "my app",
    "plugins": [
      [
        "react-native-twilio-video-webrtc",
        {
          "cameraPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera",
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
  ```

  in `app.json`. This will automatically insert

  ```text
  <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Your message to user when the camera is accessed for the first time</string>
  <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Your message to user when the microphone is accessed for the first time</string>
  ```

  into `Info.plist` of ios and insert similar requirements into `AndroidManifest.xml` of android.

- For native code, package developer will write `expo-modules` with [Expo Modules API](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/overview/) that helps bridge native code and javascript.

- **_Problem: What if they havn't?_**

- Then we will need to **_prebuild the project_**, this will generate `ios/` and `android/` folders containing the native code of the project. We then follow the guidelines to modify the native code on our own.

- After modification is done, we can continue to run `eas build` on the cloud, this time since `ios/` and `android/` exist, the cloud service will determine to use our own prebuild file to compile the application.

- A barework workflow doesn't mean you need to start `react-native-cli` (in the old days we need to physically connect our ios device to Mac in order to continue).

- After `eas build --profile development` and after we have downloaded the built mobile app from cloud, we can `expo start --dev-client` again.
