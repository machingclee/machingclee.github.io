intro: We use additional thread to execute computational task by built-in workers API

#### The Worker Object

In browser we can delegate our computational task via `Worker` API (from browser) as follows:

```js
const workerCode = `
    self.onmessage = function(e) {
        const taskInput = e.data
        // some computation using this input
        const taskOutput = ...
        self.postMessage(taskOutput)
    };
    `
const blob = new Blob([workerCode], { type: "application/javascript" })
const worker = new Worker(URL.createObjectURL(blob))

const taskInput = ...
worker.postMessage(taskInput)
worker.onmessage = (e) => {
    const taskOutput = e.data
    // set state using this output
    ...
}
```

#### Cannot pass Function as a Message into Worker

It is tempting ***not to*** define the code execution via the `workCode` string and tempting to try passing the function into the `Worker` object by  `postMessage` and let the worker asynchronously handle the function execution. 

This however is ***impossible***, we get the following error if we do so:

```text
Unhandled Rejection (DataCloneError): Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Worker': function () {
    var self = this,
        args = arguments;
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) ...<omitted>... } could not be cloned.
```

Therefore ***no dependency*** is possible to be carried into the `Worker`. In other words, `Worker` can only execute elementary tasks that the browser can understand.
