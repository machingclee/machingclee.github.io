#### Launch the Application

```python
from pywinauto.application import Application

# program_exe: the .exe file path
app_spec = Application(backend = "uia").start(program_exe)
app = app_spec["Dialog"]
```

Usually `app_spec` itself is not of our primary interest. We go into its child `'Dialog'` to start our automation task, which is a `WindowSpecification` object.

To inspect all the children of a `WindowSpecification` object, we define a util function:

```python
def view(self, spec):
  print(spec.print_control_identifiers())
  return
```
