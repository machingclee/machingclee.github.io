intro: Inside a routed component, we introduce `useRouteMatch` on type annotation and the way to extract params. 


##### Routing in This Blog Page

The routing of this react application is controlled by the following single `router.ts` file:

```typescript
interface IRouter {
  path: string,
  component: () => JSX.Element,
  exact?: boolean,
  routes?: IRouter[]
}

const routers: IRouter[] = [
  {
    path: navRoutes.ROOT,
    component: MainContent,
    routes: [
      {
        path: navRoutes.ABOUT,
        component: About,
        exact: true
      },
      {
        path: navRoutes.SKILLS,
        component: Skills,
        exact: true
      },
      ...
      {
        path: `${navRoutes.BLOG}`,
        component: Blog,
        exact: false
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Note that for a sub-routing of `navRoutes.BLOG` (`/blog`) to work, `exact: false` is important.

`MainContent` is the largest container where we want to switch from one component to another.

 I used to add another `Switch` in `Blog` component to achive this sub-routing, but recently I find a much convenient way. I call this a lazy routing since it can really achive routing in an extremely lazy but cleaner way by using `useRouteMatch`.

The `Blog` component now has the following structure:

```typescript
export default () => {

  ...
  
  const match = useRouteMatch<{ matchedArticleTitle: string }>(
    `${navRoutes.BLOG}/:matchedArticleTitle`
  );
  const { matchedArticleTitle } = match?.params || { matchedArticleTitle: "" };

  ...

  const activeBlogArticleTitle = useAppSelector(
    (state: TRootState) => state.app.blog.activeBlogArticleTitle
  );
  const selectedArticle = articles.find(
    md => md.title === activeBlogArticleTitle
  );

  ...

  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(appActions.updateBlog(
      { activeBlogArticleTitle: matchedArticleTitle }
    ));
  }, [matchedArticleTitle]);

  return (
    <div className="blog">
      ...
    </div >
  )
}
```

`useRouteMatch` catches the param in exactly the way we want. And this is cleaner than using `Route` in the sense that you can observe which route, in which way, affects this component directly inside the code of this component. 

Now on `matchedArticleTitle` changed, our `useEffect` hook will update the state of `activeBlogArticleTitle` in our `redux` store. And we can change our content based on this unique article name (as `selectedArticle` is changed).
