#### Result 



This project aims at ***experimenting*** GUI framework in Rust ecosystem.

#### Repository

- [2025-10-13-shell-script-gui-app](https://github.com/machingclee/2025-10-13-shell-script-gui-app)

#### Why Iced?


##### It is like Redux


- Iced depends everything in ***messages***, which means that we can apply traditional command/event for the frontend (which is also a pattern in WPF where each button in the XAML file has a `commmand` props). 

- In frontend we can even arrange the app as `View`s and `Slice`s as in react-redux application. Let's see it in the next section.

##### Everything is Message (Event)

For each subdomain/subpage logic we define new `struct` as a separated state, as if it is in redux state management. 

The app listens to messages to execute different action (UI state change, data persistence, data fetching, etc):


###### app_slice.rs

```rust
impl ShellScriptsAppRootState {
    pub fn update(&mut self, message: Message) -> Task<Message> {
        match message {
            Message::DatabaseConnected(db) => {
                self.db = Some(db.clone());
                self.folder_state.folder_script_repository =
                    Some(Arc::new(ScriptFolderRepository::new(db.clone())));
                self.folder_state.shell_script_repository =
                    Some(Arc::new(ShellScriptRepository::new(db.clone())));
                self.loading = false;
                println!("Database connected successfully!");
                Task::perform(async {}, |_| Message::Folder(FolderMessage::LoadFolders))
            }
            // forward message to subdomain
            Message::Folder(folder_msg) => {
                self.folder_state.update(folder_msg).map(Message::Folder)
            }
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

###### folder_slice.rs

```rust
impl FolderState {
    pub fn update(&mut self, message: FolderMessage) -> Task<FolderMessage> {
        match message {
            FolderMessage::SelectFolder(folder) => {
                self.selected_folder = Some(folder.clone());
                Task::perform(async {}, move |_| {
                    FolderMessage::FolderSelected(folder.clone())
                })
            }
            FolderMessage::FolderSelected(selected_folder) => {
                if let Some(repo) = &self.shell_script_repository {
                    let repo = repo.clone();
                    let folder_id = selected_folder.id;
                    let folder_name = selected_folder.name.clone();

                    Task::perform(
                        async move { repo.get_all_scripts_of_folder(folder_id) },
                        move |scripts| {
                            println!(
                                "Loaded {} scripts for folder {}",
                                scripts.len(),
                                folder_name
                            );
                            FolderMessage::ScriptsLoaded(scripts)
                        },
                    )
                } else {
                    Task::none()
                }
            }
            ...
        }
    }
}
```


#### Everything side effect must come from `Message`, it might be too complicated

Though everything is handled by messages, I would love to have local state that don't need to update by messages at all. But by default every button must dispatch events, that forces us to do everything via messages:

```rust
// on_delete: Message
button(text("Delete").size(14)).on_press(on_delete)
```

It might be good or bad, as a react developer I would love to separate states that is ***simply local*** (no messages needed) and some that is via redux-toolkit (***global***, by message so that everyone who subscribe the changes can notice).
