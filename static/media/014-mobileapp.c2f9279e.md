#### My Role to This Project

This is a full-stack project for Wonderbricks Limited in which I am in charge of **85% ~ 90%** of the work including 

- All visual effects for frontend 

- All business logic in backend with appropriate data model for the frontend
- DevOps for frontend and backend deployments

#### Custom Animated Components and Components Wrapped as a Class

    <tr>
      <th style="width: 320px">Description</th>
      <th> Video Demo</th>
    </tr>

<tr>
<td>
<b>Swipe to Dispatch Action.</b>

Custom component to trigger an action when we slide over a threshold

<td>
<b>3-Pages Transition Component.</b>

Custom Component to transit over 3 pages freely. It is implemented as a class with the following
- scroll lock

<b>2-Pages Transition Component.</b>

It is the same component as  above without providing left/right page as a props.

<tr>
<td>
<b>Custom Top Tab Navigation.</b>

For sure there is an alternative called *Material Top Tabs Navigator*, we decide to ***make our own one*** because

- This area is supposed to be scrollable only by our 3-pages transition component

- We want this part to be scrollable instead:

#### Enforce Good Labeling Practice to let Developers Contribute Easily

As in web development, targeting the component in codebase for modification is a tedious and frustrating task as everyone has their (or even weird) naming convention. 

By enforcing the rule to display a hint (component name, indicative string, etc) for all major components, we have reduced huge amount of time in development.

#### Lessons After this Project

##### First Time to Manage a Database from Scratch
[My self-reflection on the work I have done so far](/blog/article/Self-Reflection-on-Database-Schema-Design#What-I-failed).

##### Native Knowledge is Essential
###### Description of our Encountered Problem
Since images in react-native flicker when their parent component gets rerendered, we need to make use of a package [react-native-fast-image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image) to avoid this phenomenon. 

However, this package has not been maintained for 2 years, and some native API has been deprecated in iOS17.
I have spent tones of time browsing the discussion on github issues, folk the repo of possible solution, and make my own changes in my folked repository.

Finally I adopt my repository as the source of the package:

```json
{
    ...
    "react-native-fast-image": "https://github.com/Ching-Cheong-Lee/react-native-fast-image#fa4a38e",
}
```
in order to solve this error.

<a href="/assets/img/2024-05-04-21-03-30.png">![](/assets/img/2024-05-04-21-03-30.png)</a>

What we have solved:

- We need to run `npx tsc` to build a `/dist` folder with target in `CommonJS`, for which the error complains about. 

- Existing solutions that aim at solving iOS17 SDK problem have skipped the step of building `CommonJS` entrypoint for unknown reason.

###### Lessons


In this lesson my problem can be solved timely because

- We have someone who has the native knowledge to ***change the native code***, this will be the field of knowledge to which I have to enrich.

- We can manage our own npm package, solid knowledge in `npm` ecosystem is essential.
